00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.000
So after these obsessions are eliminated,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.259
will she really vanish into thin air?

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.720
Sins.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.400
will always be repaid one day.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.810
When that day comes,

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.160
all traces of her existence in this world

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.800
will be erased.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.460
Vanished without a trace.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.330
Spirit Lady,

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.800
if you have a way for me to help her escape the karmic fire,

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.680
you must also have a way

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.539
for me to help her change her fate.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.530
The one who tied the knot

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.320
must be the one to untie it.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.800
Only when she truly lets go of her obsessions

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.600
will it be possible

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.120
to rewrite her fate.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.120
You and she share a thousand-year bond.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.560
Now,

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.450
if you join forces with her,

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.400
there might be a glimmer of hope.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.130
Hey, Qin.

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:53.680
Dongfang.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.040
Come save me quickly!

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.840
What's wrong?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.040
Please come rescue me now!

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.440
Someone wants to kill me.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.320
Where are you now?

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.000
Who wants to kill you?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
It's one of my clients.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.660
Her mother suspects I'm seducing her daughter.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I'll go there now.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.160
Mr. Dongfang.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.930
Oh no!

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.480
Mr. Dongfang isn't planning to escape, is he?

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.920
I need to tell the manager about this right away.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:16.650
You can't go.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.240
If the manager finds out I let it slip,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.520
he'll skin me alive.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.160
What should we do then?

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.290
What is it that I shouldn't know about?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.560
Calm down.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.480
You bastard!

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:38.520
Bastard!

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.200
What took you so long?

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:42.480
Ma'am,

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.720
let's talk this through, okay?

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.200
Ma'am,

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.800
you've really misunderstood.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.730
Misunderstood?

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.520
Haitang and I

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.600
are simply in a therapist-patient relationship,

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.560
nothing more.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.120
You've clearly been planning this all along.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.640
You just want to get close to my daughter.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.170
Ma'am...

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.520
How dare you make excuses!

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.120
Oh no,

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.720
ma'am.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.200
Please calm down.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.960
Ma'am.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.410
There must be a misunderstanding.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.690
Misunderstanding?

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.520
Who do you think you are?

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.050
What's it got to do with you?

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.120
My daughter graduated from a prestigious university.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.580
She's perfectly healthy.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.279
What psychological problems could she possibly have?

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:17.920
It's clearly that beast in human clothing

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.200
using therapy as a front

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.800
just to take advantage of my daughter.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.060
Running away, are you?

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.970
I'll smash this whole place up!

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.680
Hey!

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.320
Hey!

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.640
No, don't!

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.060
You'll hurt your hand.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.240
Dr. Qin knew nothing about this.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.090
Please stop blaming him, okay?

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.370
Zou Haitang,

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.690
shut your mouth!

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.130
I'll deal with you when we get home.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.050
Ma'am, let's sit down and talk.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.560
Take your hands off me.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.960
I see

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.240
you and that beast

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.620
are birds of a feather.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.080
Hey!

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.260
Stay away from my daughter and me.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.640
Boss.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.600
What are you doing here?

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.520
If I hadn't come,

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.450
you would've been beaten to death.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.320
Be careful.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.120
I'm already an adult.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.520
Why won't you give me

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.120
even a little bit of freedom?

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.680
Why?

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.600
Haitang.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.930
Haitang.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.730
Haitang.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.450
Haitang, what's wrong?

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.000
Haitang.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.040
Haitang.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.010
What's wrong, Haitang?

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.330
Haitang.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.960
Haitang.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.530
Haitang.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.010
Haitang.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.159
Haitang.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.580
Don't scare mommy.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.850
Haitang.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.620
Mom is only doing what's best for you.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.610
Haitang.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.800
Haitang.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.240
Haitang.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.040
Haitang.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:29.600
Haitang.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.130
We should be able to see her again soon.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.530
I need to tell Qin Qi.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.450
He doesn't know about this girl's situation.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:40.780
This person

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.900
Don't see him again in the future.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.400
He's not as simple as you think.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.000
Why?

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.570
He's my good friend.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.420
Suit yourself.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:54.800
So strange.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.400
The way that girl was acting just now.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.520
Her mother still had to come find you.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.640
What can I do?

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.000
She's just crazy.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.400
What's really going on with this girl?

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.480
Why is she so frightening when she eats?

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.600
She has serious emotional issues.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.300
If this continues,

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.700
not only will her emotions collapse,

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.520
but her body won't hold up either.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.640
It's all because of her mother,

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.120
caused by excessive control over a long period.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.720
She is quite pitiful indeed.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:35.980
When her heart can't bear it anymore,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.460
she finds comfort in food.

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:44.330
Alright,

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.260
let's not talk about her anymore.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.400
How have you been lately?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.460
I'm doing great at the inn.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.260
Let me tell you,

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.410
our inn is really interesting.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.720
There's this total bootlicker,

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.800
and there's also a little pig spirit.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.530
A pig spirit!

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.060
Your condition is getting worse.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.280
You should come to me for treatment for a while.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.900
You don't understand.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:25.660
Innkeeper,

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.480
I'm back.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.760
Mr. Dongfang,

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.680
the innkeeper doesn't seem to be in a good mood.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.320
Newcomer,

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:40.720
weren't you leaving?

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.980
Why are you back again?

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.500
Innkeeper.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:57.580
Innkeeper.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:52.600
Innkeeper.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.130
The rice is cold.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.850
I made some noodles for you.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:56.460
I'll go.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.000
Zou Haitang.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:35.660
Why is she here?

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.200
Isn't it because you brought her from the healing room?

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:39.800
Could it be

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.210
that she's our next client?

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.660
What should we do with her now?

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:49.800
Throw her out.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.040
She'll forget everything that happened today by tomorrow anyway.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:52.840
That won't do,

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:54.400
boss.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.120
Is this how you've been treating your clients?

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.320
No wonder the complaint rate is so high.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.650
I don't need you telling me how to do my job.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:01.920
Since she's a client,

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.580
we should treat her properly.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.240
Besides, the deeper her obsession,

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.900
the more it will benefit you once it's resolved.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.930
Take him to a guest room.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.610
Clean it up quickly.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.800
Don't delay our inn's business.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.000
Yes, innkeeper!

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.080
My knife!

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.560
Who came last night?

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.200
The edge of my knife is all bent.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.400
Stop arguing.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.040
It was the new guest who arrived yesterday.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.120
I'm sorry.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.530
I've caused trouble for everyone.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.880
Coming to someone's place without notice,

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.160
messing with other people's things,

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.960
you should be thrown out!

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.040
Calm down.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.460
I truly apologize.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.180
I'll definitely clean up the inn.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.800
And I'll compensate everyone for the damaged items.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.920
Can you even afford it?

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:13.880
Come on.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:14.480
Calm down.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.180
It's okay, don't blame yourself.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.890
You didn't do it on purpose.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.040
We'll restore everything to its original state.

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:25.520
But,

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.000
what happened to you?

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.720
Since you've come to the Monster Inn,

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.760
you are our guest.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.420
Why don't we...

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.410
go upstairs and have a proper talk?

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:39.700
You two,

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:40.920
continue cleaning.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:41.850
Yes, innkeeper!

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.650
Do you know where this place is?

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:00.840
No, I don't.

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.920
Then how did you get here?

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.640
I followed you all the way here.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.490
But as soon as I arrived,

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.700
I started feeling very hungry again,

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.450
and then I lost consciousness.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.100
May I ask where this is?

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.370
This is the Monster Inn.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:16.720
This place

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.380
isn't somewhere just anyone can come to.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.400
Monster Inn?

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:22.610
So are you all

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.040
monsters?

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.370
Don't be afraid.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.440
We won't hurt you.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:34.920
Do you need our help?

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:35.900
Tell us.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:36.840
Perhaps

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.140
we can help you.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.440
Are you going to talk?

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.240
If not, then leave.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:45.700
Go home.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.560
No, no, no.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.640
I won't go home.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.060
I don't want to see her.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.040
Who is she?

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.240
She's my mom.

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.640
My mom is very good to me.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:59.770
She loves me so much.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:01.810
She loves me to the point

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.240
that it suffocates me.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:36.800
Haitang.
