00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.479
Farewell.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.400
You wretched chrysanthemum spirit,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.729
trapped for years and still unrepentant.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.050
Shopkeeper Shangguan,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.640
why won't you ever let me go?

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.280
Come back.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.170
The time has come, chrysanthemum spirit.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.919
I'm sorry

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.240
for startling you.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.170
Who's speaking?

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.040
I didn't mean to harm you.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.480
Would you mind watering me?

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:34.840
I am Tao Shi.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.280
Your great kindness,

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.480
I shall never forget.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.800
Are you human or ghost?

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.880
I was human a thousand years ago.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.320
Benefactor,

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.360
you need not be afraid.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.400
I won't harm you.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.280
Just call me Dongfang Zhaobai.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.220
Brother Dongfang.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.210
Why are you in this monster inn?

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.960
Could it be

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.240
you're also here because of an obsession?

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.700
I should have vanished a thousand years ago,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
but because of a promise to a friend,

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.280
therefore,

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.600
I had no choice but to remain in this form.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.000
Do spirits have friends too?

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.720
For a thousand years,

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.040
I've been trapped here by the innkeeper,

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.320
unable to escape.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.160
I was about to perish,

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.760
but fortunately,

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.640
you saved me.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.140
It's that Shangguan Feiye again.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.060
She truly is a habitual offender,

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.280
even more frightening than monsters.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.880
Well,

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.100
never mind, I was just passing by.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.600
It was nothing.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.520
Don't worry about it.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.200
Bye-bye.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.500
Brother Dongfang.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.090
Benefactor,

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.180
may I ask one more favor of you?

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.360
I'm just an ordinary person.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.200
I really can't help you.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.000
Please,

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.000
I beg you.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.520
You're the only one who can help me here.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.820
Brother Dongfang,

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.210
please drink this wine.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.280
You will then know what happened that year

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.040
and realize

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.440
I have not been lying.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.160
This is the scene

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.560
of our last encounter.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.720
Indeed.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.080
Back then,

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.090
I was fortunate to meet you,

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.720
which inspired me to create this painting.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.220
Your heart guides your brush,

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.840
capturing essence without confusion.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.570
Brother Gao,

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.000
your brushwork is truly masterful.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.080
In this world,

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.140
the one who understands me

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.920
is Tao Shi.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.880
That day

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.760
I fell gravely ill during my journey to the imperial examination.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.960
My life was in danger.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.760
It was you, Brother Gao, a complete stranger,

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.760
who saved my life.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.440
Your great kindness

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.280
I, Tao Shi,

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.880
will never forget.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.360
If our positions were reversed,

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.560
you wouldn't have left me to die either.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.520
Besides,

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.680
wealth is easy to come by,

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.080
but a kindred spirit is hard to find.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.810
I've also gained a true friend,

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.240
so I'm only winning here.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.320
Ha!

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.290
Brother Gao,

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.220
why don't we

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.080
meet here on this day next year?

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.240
I'll brew chrysanthemum wine

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.440
and wait for you here.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.360
The two of us

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.400
can continue today's friendship.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.260
What do you say?

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.320
Wonderful!

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.040
I was thinking the same.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.720
Our chrysanthemum wine appointment,

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.960
it's a promise.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.760
Brother Gao,

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.380
the flowers have bloomed,

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.840
and the wine is ready.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.960
But I...

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:07.800
I'm afraid

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.810
I cannot keep our appointment.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.600
In the next life,

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.280
I will surely

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.300
drink wine and admire chrysanthemums with you.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.450
Times have changed.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.800
You still haven't let go?

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.620
Brother Dongfang,

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.600
this is the only lingering regret

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.000
that keeps me in this world.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.330
If I take this pot of wine

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.960
and go through that door,

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.640
I can travel to the world of a thousand years ago.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.770
To find Brother Gao.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.360
Wait!

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.160
Taoshi, you know

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.320
what will happen if you go through this door.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.800
He hasn't done anything wrong.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.860
He just wants to fulfill his promise.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.400
Besides, isn't your monster inn

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.000
supposed to help monsters resolve their obsessions?

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.600
That's what you said.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.060
Shut up.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.240
What would a newcomer like you know?

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.480
If you dare take one step outside,

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.080
you'll vanish into thin air before an incense stick burns out.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.560
You better think carefully.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.220
Innkeeper.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:26.700
I'm not afraid.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.480
Even if I'm reduced to dust,

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.480
I still have to go.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.210
I'll take you there.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:34.960
Wait.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.360
What is it now?

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.920
Weren't you planning to escape?

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.080
What capacity are you taking him in?

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.280
I've decided to stay.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.060
Just temporarily though.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:05.240
Please.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.640
Old friends depart one by one.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.320
Rivers flow on alone.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.720
Suddenly seeing a visitor from dreams.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.200
How many times will we grieve?

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.080
My friend,

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.960
are you here to see the chrysanthemums?

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.760
I'm here on someone's behalf,

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.020
to represent a friend,

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.570
for an appointment.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.730
Brother Gao,

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.120
for our chrysanthemum wine appointment,

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:05.720
I'm here.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.400
Tao Shi.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.760
Tao Shi had no attachment

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.410
to this bustling world.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.930
He was simply unfortunate,

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.400
breaking his promise to meet you for chrysanthemum wine.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.200
But even so...

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.200
He survived a thousand years through sheer will,

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.260
never forgetting his promise to you.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.760
Today he finally comes to fulfill that promise.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:34.960
Please, Brother Gao,

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.050
drink this cup of wine from Tao Shi.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.320
My friend.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.800
Tao Shi is right here.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.080
My friend.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.080
Brother Gao.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.040
Just for one meeting,

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.400
you'll turn to dust for this.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.240
Is it worth it?

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.240
Actually,

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.090
you weren't trying to trap Tao Shi,

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.440
but protecting him,

00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.000
right?

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.690
Don't think so highly of me.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.220
I don't work overtime.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:11.730
What's this?

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.410
You want to stay now?

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.040
I think this job is quite interesting,

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.800
like playing a murder mystery game.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:18.660
Once you agree,

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.220
there's no going back.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.320
Of course.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.680
What are you standing there for?

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.340
Get to work.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:30.960
I'm not finished yet.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.600
I don't work overtime,

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.060
especially night shifts.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.680
Two days off per week,

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.920
no working on holidays either.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:38.520
Unless...

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:39.480
Triple pay.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.820
No, five times the pay.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:43.440
Keep talking,

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.210
and I'll feed you to the demons.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.040
Wait for me!

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.880
Great benefits,

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.520
easy work,

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.440
and a monster inn that helps guests resolve their obsessions.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.800
You haven't joined some scam organization, have you?

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.200
What scam organization?

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.120
To be precise,

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.640
they're special guests.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.840
Anyway, I've decided to stay and give it a try.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.570
Where did you say this place is?

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.660
I can't really explain that clearly.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.760
A car will come to pick me up anyway.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.020
Is it that mysterious?

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:13.760
Monster Inn.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.800
When can you take me there for a look?

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.400
You just stay put right here.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.280
Our place

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.080
doesn't hire people who wear glasses.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.680
At least leave me an address.

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.240
I might even refer some customers to you.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.170
Destined guests

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.090
who hear the name of Monster Inn

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.050
will naturally be invited to come.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:31.820
Cheers!

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.800
Shangguan Feiye.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.060
You really are a devil.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.850
Have you always resolved customers' obsessions so violently?

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.240
The manager's business

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.440
is none of your concern.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:01.960
Get back to work.
