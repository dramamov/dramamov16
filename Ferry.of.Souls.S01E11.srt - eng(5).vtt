00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.840
Why is he alone here?

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.320
Where are the others?

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.120
Isn't he afraid of being eaten by the man-eating demon?

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.380
What if he's not human?

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:48.560
He's a demon?

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.080
Oh my!

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.280
What would you like to ask, sir?

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.080
I, Master Ma,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.920
know astronomy above,

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.600
geography below,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.560
and can change fate itself!

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.400
Sir, your forehead is full,

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.080
your eyes are bright,

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.040
you must be destined for wealth and longevity!

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.280
You've come to the right person with Master Ma.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.280
Tell me what you need.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.210
Long time no see,

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.970
you bootlicker.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.400
Bootlicker?

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.440
How is it you?

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.600
Come out now.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.800
You've forgotten me so quickly?

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.000
How could I possibly forget you,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.040
Sister Shangguan?

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.760
Everyone knows

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.620
you're the most powerful demon hunter in the world.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.880
What brings you here?

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.320
I've been behaving myself lately,

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.520
following demon rules,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.250
not causing any trouble at all.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.320
I know you've been behaving.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.040
Aren't you supposed to know everything?

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.400
I need to ask you about something.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.240
Ask?

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.720
You scared me!

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.540
This must be your husband?

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.800
Huh?

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.280
Please tell me what you need,

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.680
I'll hold nothing back,

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.240
and tell you everything I know.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.040
Let me ask you,

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.000
what's been happening at the Zou family recently?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.600
Is there a man-eating demon?

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.120
Yes, yes.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.600
Oh no,

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.040
you two aren't planning to capture the man-eating demon, are you?

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.240
I strongly advise you both

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.440
to be extremely careful.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.400
Cut the nonsense.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.600
Tell us what you know.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.130
Please, have a seat.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.600
Speaking of the Zou family,

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.200
they're truly known by everyone,

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.800
famous throughout the land.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.800
Master Zou

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.860
is the wealthiest man in town.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.610
He and his wife, Madam Wang Zou,

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.810
have quite a beautiful love story.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.280
Back in the day,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.480
Madam Zou

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.420
was the top courtesan in town.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.280
Her figure...

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.530
Get to the point.

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.480
The couple has a daughter

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.620
named Zou Haitang.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.200
She came of age two years ago

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.800
and has remained unmarried.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.200
The Zou family has vast wealth

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.780
and dominates the region.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.680
Miss Zou

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.280
is truly the apple of everyone's eye.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.520
Master Zou even

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.720
spent a fortune to build

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.660
the Golden Embroidery Tower.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.640
This Miss Zou

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.680
since birth

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.600
has lived in this Golden Embroidery Tower

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.200
and has never left it.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.519
Except for her personal maids,

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.450
no outsiders are allowed to enter.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.240
She is truly

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.210
a sheltered young lady from a noble family who never steps outside.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.180
Miss Zou is as beautiful as a heavenly fairy.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.880
Master Zou has even

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.600
arranged an excellent marriage for his daughter.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.480
She is to be married to the son of the current prefect,

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.240
forming a prestigious alliance between their families.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.800
But for some unknown reason.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.400
On the eve of the engagement,

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.600
Miss Zou suddenly died.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.560
Mrs. Zou,

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.200
devastated by the loss of her beloved daughter,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.080
her hair turned white overnight.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.880
Haitang.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.120
What's even more bizarre is that

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.600
Haitang,

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.930
after Miss Zou's death,

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.440
she transformed into a terrifying man-eating monster

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.500
wreaking havoc in the Zou household.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.880
First, she devoured her own mother.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.800
Then,

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.090
she ate the entire wedding procession

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.520
and nearly consumed her own father too.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.080
In no time,

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.560
the entire street

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.360
was gripped by terror.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.050
I don't know anything else.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.880
I never thought this man-eating demon

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.810
would even devour his own parents.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.960
Brother-in-law.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.660
Please be extremely careful.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.320
Poor Master Zou,

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.480
in a single night,

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.280
lost both his beloved wife and daughter.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.810
It's truly heartbreaking.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.050
How could there be such a coincidence?

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.240
If he lost his wife and daughter,

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.840
shouldn't the Zou household be holding a funeral?

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:44.920
Why are there

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.040
festive lanterns hanging at the entrance?

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.640
I don't know about that, sir.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.200
Looks like we need to visit the Zou residence

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.530
to investigate the situation ourselves.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.600
My powers are too weak.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.240
I'm afraid I can't help with anything else.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:11.720
Brother-in-law.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.000
You two have such great powers,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.880
this minor man-eating demon should be no challenge for you.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:15.600
Heh heh,

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.600
no need to waste words with him.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.130
Let's go.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.960
Brother-in-law,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
the jianghu is vast,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.760
we may never meet again.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.520
Farewell.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.600
Heh heh heh.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.060
You don't need to be so sad.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.440
We'll have plenty of time

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.570
to get to know each other in the future.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.159
It seems the Zou family

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.040
is hiding something serious.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.560
How are we going to sneak in there?

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.820
I'm not pretending to be your wife again.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.440
Not as a couple?

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.200
Brother-in-law.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.520
Follow me.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.080
Please come in, honored guests.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.160
The clothes at our Jinxiu Pavilion

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.120
are among the finest in the city.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.160
However,

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:14.920
I'm not sure if

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.650
you've brought enough silver.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.640
Little pig demon.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.640
Who are you?

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.440
How did you know I'm a demon?

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.040
I forgot for a moment.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.970
You don't know me yet at this point.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.140
It doesn't matter.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.520
We're demon hunters.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.650
But don't worry,

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.890
we're here to catch another demon,

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.960
not you.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.040
Bring out your most expensive

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:39.159
and finest items.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.659
Right away!

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.480
This outfit of yours

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:38.919
needs to be paired with this hairpin

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:39.760
to be perfect.

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:42.520
However,

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.380
this hairpin is quite expensive.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.520
Let me see.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.060
Not bad.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.160
I like it.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.760
Please wrap up all these items for me too.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:55.420
Right away.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.520
Hey, wait.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:58.730
Shopkeeper.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.920
We can't carry all these purchases.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.850
Let's focus on our main task first.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.600
Do you need anything else?

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.460
Let me borrow this.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.400
Oh my!

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.080
Please take pity on me.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.600
My hometown was struck by disaster.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.240
I haven't had a drop of water for 7 days.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.800
I heard Master Zou is a generous man.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.040
Could you spare me a bite to eat?

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.000
Alright.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:48.440
Let's go.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.080
Master Zou.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:49.920
Mind your manners.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:50.560
Sir.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.680
This poor child.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.730
Judging by your age,

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.000
you're about the same age as my daughter.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.920
I simply can't bear to see you suffer.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.200
Come,

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.560
please get up.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.200
Wait.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.180
Do you really think

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.930
she's an ordinary girl?

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.320
Then who is she?

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.200
Who are you two?

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.240
We were passing by

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.640
and sensed demonic energy in your home.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.900
Would it be convenient

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.800
for us to enter and investigate?

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.000
Of course.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.560
Masters,

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.640
please follow me.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.440
It's all my fault.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.880
It's all my fault indeed.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.640
Every day,

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.040
I've only focused on my business

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.000
and failed to take care of the mother and daughter.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.800
My condolences, Mr. Zou.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.780
No one can predict accidents.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.640
It's such a pity.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.040
My precious daughter,

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.280
whom I raised for fifteen years,

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.120
is gone just like that.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.400
Fifteen years?

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.360
As far as I know,

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.920
Miss Zou had her coming-of-age ceremony two years ago.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.400
She should be 17 this year.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.360
Oh, right.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.250
17 years old.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.200
The prime of her youth at 17,

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.880
and she never got to enjoy it.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:01.540
She just...

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.130
Please don't be too sad.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.100
The most urgent matter now

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.600
is to catch the man-eating demon

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.520
to prevent it from harming more people.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:14.160
Ah, right.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:15.800
Yes, yes, yes.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.160
Masters,

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:18.780
please quickly

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.360
rid my home of this demon.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.520
I've prepared fine quarters

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.200
and delicious meals for you.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:25.800
Why don't

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.000
you both rest today?

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.580
Thank you, sir.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.020
Innkeeper,

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.050
don't you think this Mr. Zou

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.490
seems a bit suspicious?

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:50.690
Tell me more.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.420
Think about it.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.200
His wife and daughter just died,

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.860
yet he's still wearing gold and silver jewelry.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.720
He pretends to be sad,

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.320
but still puts effort into his appearance.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.050
And also,

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.560
he's known as a loving father,

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.920
yet he forgot his own daughter's age.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.520
That's clearly suspicious.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.120
You're not so stupid after all.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:10.800
Of course.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:12.920
Don't worry.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.320
If there's something wrong, he'll slip up eventually.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.520
We'll know when we catch him.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.320
That's true.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.480
This Mr. Zou

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.480
is truly a wealthy merchant.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.460
The room he prepared for us

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.360
is really nice.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.520
Innkeeper,

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.160
there's even a bathtub in here

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.760
with hot water already in it.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.770
I'm going to take a bath.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.380
What are you doing?

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:55.720
Taking a bath.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.200
I'm still here.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.360
If you want to bathe, go somewhere else.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.160
Don't forget.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.920
We're cultivation partners now.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.880
If I leave now,

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.800
people will think we're not getting along.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:05.840
That I'm inadequate.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.640
It'll affect our mission later.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.040
Who dares to say that about me?

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.300
I'll break their legs.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:11.600
Oh my.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.200
Don't be angry.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.290
I'll just take the loss.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.320
Who's there?

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.130
Don't come in and see me!

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.560
So comfortable.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:39.400
Boss.

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.520
I've been working with you for a while now.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.980
How do you think I'm doing?

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.040
Very well.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.010
I think I'm doing very well too.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.920
I think I'm

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.300
fairly good-looking.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.650
I'm perceptive.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.100
Most importantly,

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.800
I'm capable.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000
And obedient too.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.080
Don't you agree?

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.080
So I think

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.450
you should treat me better from now on.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.250
How can there be good employees without good bosses?

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.120
Right?

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.160
Boss, are you listening?

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.600
Where are my clothes?

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.080
Boss.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:33.930
Shanguan Feiye.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.840
Weren't you just singing your own praises?

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.840
Handle this small matter yourself.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:47.600
Boss.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.280
I've been thinking it over

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.930
and can't sleep in the middle of the night.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.040
Masters,

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.200
why don't we find a place to hide first?

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.600
Just waiting here

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.200
is too dangerous.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.000
The man-eating demon has powerful magic.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.760
Hiding anywhere would be useless.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.400
Rather than waiting for death,

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.260
we should face the enemy head-on.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.320
Okay.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.040
All right.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.080
She's coming.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.640
She's here.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.600
Protect the master!
