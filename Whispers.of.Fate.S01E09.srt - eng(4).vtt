[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.940
[Episode 9]

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.710
Rebirth Scroll?

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.430
Tang Lici's things may be disgusting,

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.440
but they still have some use.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.310
Die!

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.070
Looks like we're entering the next act.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.729
Three Character Classic

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.010
You're back?

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.000
Shen!

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.450
Did you find any clues?

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.079
I saw Liu Yan.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.980
Where?

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.980
Shen, what's wrong?

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.329
There's something

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:54.030
on him.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.590
Hiding behind a facade,

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.910
putting on a mysterious air.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.360
Sound Killing Technique.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.860
I should have known it was you.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:20.910
It's been four years

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.240
and your methods are still so crude.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:25.430
Crude?

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.680
You truly are cold-blooded.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.070
In your eyes,

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:32.630
haven't I always been

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.760
a cold-blooded and heartless person?

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.600
What,

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.720
you're having doubts now?

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:41.159
Doubts?

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.710
No.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.390
Since you killed Fang Zhou

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:45.520
right in front of me,

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.600
I've never doubted

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.460
that you're a cold-blooded
and heartless monster.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.680
Yan,

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.900
listen to me.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:04.600
That day,

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.540
-it wasn't what you think.
-Excuses!

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:10.510
Tang Lici,

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.510
four years ago, I slit your throat

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:14.970
with great satisfaction.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:16.930
Today, here,

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:18.910
I'll kill you again.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:22.600
Four years ago,

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.800
you couldn't kill me.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.040
And now,

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.800
you only dare to face me

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.800
in this illusion.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.800
You have even less courage than before.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.560
Claiming to do things you can't
is just boasting.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.610
Tang Lici,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.190
you're already a wandering ghost.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.620
Why did you come back?

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:47.390
Yes.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.130
Because you're an inhuman,

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.680
undying,

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.400
and ungrateful

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.270
monster.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:58.280
Monster?

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.920
Yan,

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:06.360
if I am a monster.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.680
then what are you?

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:37.159
You were so eager to see me.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.010
Isn't it because you want to

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.600
take the other half
of the Rebirth Scroll from me?

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.400
What's wrong?

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.280
Realized your days are numbered

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.000
and afraid to die again?

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:55.690
Sir.

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:58.270
Sir?

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.570
Does it hurt?

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:16.290
You couldn't kill me four years ago.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:18.390
And four years later,

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:20.330
you still haven't improved at all.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.370
You've switched to framing others.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.360
Is it because
you can't bring yourself to kill?

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.290
Or have you finally discovered...

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.240
Your own helplessness?

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.270
Can't bring myself to kill?

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:37.510
That's absurd.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.830
If this were truly a setup,

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:40.720
how could I let someone like you,

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.950
the world's biggest hypocrite,

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:42.840
escape punishment

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.390
and play the role of

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:45.520
a righteous savior?

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.600
To watch you continue this act,

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.440
it's not a waste for me

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:51.870
to postpone your death a little longer.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.860
How long do you think
you can keep up this act?

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.150
You'll soon expose

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:57.100
your true nature,

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.190
because you don't know how to save people.

00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:59.390
You can only destroy.

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:01.390
Everything that comes close to you

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:02.790
will be destroyed by you.

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.620
Zhoudi Tower should never have saved you.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:06.960
Zhoudi Tower...

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.700
I had already forgotten

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.430
that place.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:22.550
However,

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.190
since you brought it up,

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:26.980
I should still thank you.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:29.610
Fang Zhou brought me back.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:31.430
Yan,

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:33.790
it was you

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:35.740
who healed me.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:38.850
I should never have saved you!

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:45.790
You shouldn't be alive.

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:47.860
Once you reveal your true nature,

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.190
no one in this world will want you

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.740
to live.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.150
You know that, don't you?

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:52.640
Without you,

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:54.340
everyone in this world

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:55.750
would be better off.

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:59.100
Better off.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.790
I regret it.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.150
I regret saving you,

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:09.470
giving you the chance
to deceive Fang Zhou,

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:10.710
letting you harm him

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:12.030
and destroy

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.490
the Zhoudi Tower
we tried so hard to protect!

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:28.750
You're wrong.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:29.860
What you regret is

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.150
that to kill me,

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:32.550
you've become

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:35.910
neither human nor monster.

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:43.740
You keep saying

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.070
you believe what you saw.

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:47.270
You're convinced

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:48.330
I killed Fang Zhou.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.070
But deep down,

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:51.910
you shamefully have doubts.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:53.670
What if?

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:56.450
What if there's the slightest chance

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:58.310
that you're wrong?

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:03.910
So,

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:05.910
you keep testing me,

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.700
trying to see

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:09.310
if I really am a cold-blooded

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:10.570
and heartless person.

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:12.200
Would killing me

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:13.740
really allow you to

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:14.860
serve justice?

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:21.860
Yan,

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:23.860
to kill me,

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:24.820
this evil being,

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:27.490
you became a fallen angel,

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.700
a lonely hero in the night.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:31.100
But

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:32.500
you're afraid.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:43.910
You fear that all of this

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:45.920
is just your imagination.

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:52.550
You fear it's all

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:53.460
just a false excuse

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.660
you made up to kill me.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:58.670
You're afraid...

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.030
you'll kill the wrong person.

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:06.430
Am I right?

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:17.790
No.

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:18.740
No.

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.500
Stop trying to manipulate me
with your words.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.500
You may have fooled Fang Zhou,

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.700
but you can't fool me.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.460
You hypocrite and liar!

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:31.820
I really envy you.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:32.820
You killed Fang Zhou,

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.220
destroyed Zhoudi Tower,

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:36.840
and still live so comfortably
with yourself.

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:02.980
This qin is in your hands?

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.700
Human nature is good at birth.

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:13.150
Lici.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:15.580
This qin

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.440
is called the Heart-Moon Return.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.310
The name's meaning

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:24.210
expresses hope that when you play it,

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:26.430
it can ignite the fire in your heart,

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.190
cleanse your mind,
and guide you to goodness.

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:31.270
However,

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.070
if you truly want to
follow the path of goodness,

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:35.930
you must persevere until the end.

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:37.730
To accomplish this

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.700
is indeed very,

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:41.150
very difficult.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:45.460
Today,

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:47.100
I will

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.310
give this zither to you.

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.100
You don't do enough good
to be truly virtuous,

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:54.980
and when you do evil,

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.620
you can't commit great evil either.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:57.100
Yan,

00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:58.910
with your personality,

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:00.700
you can never reach
the extremes of good or evil.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:01.460
In the end,

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.580
you're destined to accomplish nothing.

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:04.340
Give up.

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.150
You're still trying to
manipulate with words.

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:08.070
Raging Thunder!

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:10.000
Shattered Jade Across the Realms!

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.860
Joy.

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:55.100
Anger.

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:56.500
Sorrow.

00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:57.730
Happiness.

00:15:58.700 --> 00:15:59.460
Worry.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.070
Fear.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:02.270
Dread.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.370
Tang Lici,

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:12.980
I want to destroy
all seven of your emotions

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.790
and atone for your sins before Fang Zhou!

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:15.910
Go to hell!

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:18.880
Shock the universe,
seven sounds extinguished!

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:20.510
White Dragon Taizhen Dance.

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:36.910
The one Fang Zhou chose
to inherit his legacy

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:37.910
was never you,

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:39.190
but me.

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:15.060
Yan,

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:17.020
the illusion is broken.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:18.480
You must be feeling awful.

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:50.630
You woke up first.

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:53.150
How boring.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:01.690
Move aside.

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:06.520
I congratulated

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.500
you and the Master

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:10.060
on a happy reunion.

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:11.910
Sir,

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:15.060
why are you so cold?

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:16.390
Shen Langhun,

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:17.820
the illusion,

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:19.870
and now, you.

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.520
These three useless moves

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:24.240
have already made me

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:25.980
lose my patience.

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:27.870
Useless moves?

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.380
If you want to be my opponent,

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:47.110
you're not good enough.

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:49.540
Your opponent

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.670
is not me.

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:53.590
Since you're so clever,

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:56.390
why don't you guess

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:57.870
what Master

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.880
will do to your friends

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:01.460
next?

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:06.450
What does he want to do?

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:07.870
Master said

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:10.950
you

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:13.480
must pay the price.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:28.780
Master said

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:31.350
your physique is exceptionally strong.

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:32.910
No matter how severe the injuries,

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:34.220
as long as you don't die,

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:35.300
you can recover.

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:37.460
But the only wound

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:38.390
you cannot heal

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:39.690
is in your abdomen.

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:41.670
Master has deliberately

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:43.500
mixed something into the misty flower sea

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.700
that will trigger

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:45.780
your old wound.

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:48.220
And my blood

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:50.580
is the catalyst.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:27.630
Trigger the old wound?

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:36.870
I was here first!

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:38.180
[Wanqiao Chamber Account Book Collection]

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:40.350
Everyone, please calm down.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:40.780
Take it easy.

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:41.710
I was here first!

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:43.740
I was here first!

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:45.590
Don't push.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:47.760
I was here first.

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.420
Everyone, please be patient.
One at a time.

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:53.400
Don't rush.

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:54.780
We are here

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:56.740
because we want to get rich

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:57.600
with all of you.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:20:59.190
Sir, look,

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:00.220
we've all been waiting

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.420
for quite a while now.

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:03.570
What kind of fleets

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:05.830
are worthy of working with you?

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:07.150
I see you all

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.600
have brought your account books.

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:11.990
Hand them over for us to examine.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:13.670
Those who have worked with

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:15.730
major clients in the past three years

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:16.830
will have a chance.

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:18.160
In the past three years?

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.520
No...

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:20.720
No hurry.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:22.230
No rush, no need to hurry.

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:24.430
Our account books

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:26.150
are our most valuable possessions.

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:26.540
That's right.

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:27.150
Exactly.

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:28.950
This wasn't the rule before.

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:30.980
If we hand them all over to you,

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:32.630
what if the information in our accounts

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:33.430
gets leaked?

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.150
How can we continue

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:36.630
our business at the docks?

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:38.630
So, we can't hand over
these account books.

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:39.220
We can't.

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:40.830
In this world, there's never gain

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:42.020
without sacrifice.

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:44.400
You may lose your former clients,

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:45.630
but you'll gain Wanqiao Chamber

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:46.630
as a new client.

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:48.170
This is a trade-off

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.520
that you all should understand clearly.

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:51.830
That may be true,

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:53.060
but I think...

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:54.430
Wanqiao Chamber

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:56.060
has mountains of wealth

00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:58.150
precisely because our business

00:21:58.150 --> 00:21:59.220
never loses money.

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:00.690
Yes, we understand.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:01.630
Since you all

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:04.590
don't even have the courage
to submit your account books,

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:05.540
the exit is that way.

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:06.300
No, no, no.

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:06.910
We...

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:09.110
I'm willing to provide my account book.

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:13.300
Our fleet

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:14.830
is clean and honest.

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:16.260
We have nothing to hide.

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:16.950
That's why I say

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:17.950
you cowards

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:19.300
will never make big money.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:20.220
But it doesn't matter.

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:21.150
This way, no one will

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:22.020
compete with me for this deal.

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.750
Everyone, the exit is that way.

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:25.300
This young sir

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:26.660
is so courageous

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:27.660
and straightforward.

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:29.110
You're the kind of person
Wanqiao Chamber appreciates.

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:30.150
Please, come aboard.

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:31.020
This way, sir.

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:31.830
Please.

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:33.250
Time to make money!

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:35.080
He's allowed to get on the boat already?

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:35.940
Will this work?

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:36.990
Relax.

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:38.390
Walk forward.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:38.990
Let's go.

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:39.670
One.

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:40.630
Two.

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.950
Wait!

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:41.350
Three.

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:42.260
Wait!

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.350
Wait!

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:46.300
Sir,

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:48.220
our accounts are clean too.

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:48.700
Right?

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.220
Yes, they're clean.

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:51.350
We have nothing to hide.

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:52.300
That's right.

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:53.260
Sir, I've thought it through too.

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:54.910
We'll submit our books as well. Come on.

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:56.540
Yes, we'll all submit them.

00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:58.670
Come on.

00:22:58.670 --> 00:22:59.980
Everyone gets a turn.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.240
Everyone has a chance.

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.030
Don't rush, don't rush.

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:04.390
Why are you dawdling?

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:05.260
Come on, one at a time!

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:06.020
One at a time.

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:08.020
Line up!

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:13.950
By order of the Sword King City's lord,

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:15.300
during the Sword Duel Festival,

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.630
all vessels on the canal

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:18.020
are forbidden from private gatherings,

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:18.740
banquets,

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:19.980
concealing weapons,

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:20.950
or engaging in combat.

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:22.150
Those who have not registered

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:23.740
are forbidden from conducting business.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.020
Those without an official sword token

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:26.150
may not leave the city.

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:27.780
If Wanqiao Chamber wants to do business,

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.980
you must wait until after
the Sword Duel Festival.

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:31.110
These are the rules.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:32.150
Mind your own business

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:33.350
and stay in your lane.

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:34.950
The rules of Sword King City

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:35.630
don't apply to

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:36.830
the Wanqiao Chamber.

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:37.820
Move them out!

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:41.080
What are you doing?

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.060
Chi, what should we do?

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:46.910
Stop!

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:50.830
Chi.

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:52.030
Chi Yun, are you okay?

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:54.420
As expected of Cloud.

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:56.470
Your belly is full of cotton.

00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:57.780
I'm impressed.

00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:58.740
Look, everyone!

00:23:58.740 --> 00:23:59.220
Is this a scam?

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:00.540
Isn't this the same person from before?

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:02.600
Turns out he was wearing a fake beard.

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:03.300
Chi Yun!

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:04.190
Don't be impulsive.

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:04.950
We've been tricked.

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:05.500
Yeah!

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:06.380
Calm down.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:10.740
Yu Furen, Commander of Sword King City,

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:13.740
pays respects to the Branch Chief
of Shanfeng Branch,

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:14.460
Ms. Zhong.

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:15.500
Mr. Yu,

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:17.060
the Sword Duel Festival in Sword King City

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:19.020
welcomes heroes from all over the world.

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:21.260
Wanqiao Chamber
is just running a business.

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:22.590
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:23.720
Why cause conflict?

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:24.750
You're right.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:26.170
If that's the case,

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:27.350
Wanqiao Chamber should

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:29.080
return all these account books

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:31.960
and promise to follow
Sword King City's rules

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:33.460
from now on.

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.540
Then, I will immediately apologize

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:37.910
to Mr. Chi.

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:39.460
Mr. Yu,

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:41.700
right now, we're just

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.430
collecting account books for examination.

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:45.300
As for discussing business deals,

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:46.960
that may still take some time.

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:49.390
Sword King City is responsible for
imperial transport.

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:51.780
If any confidential information
about the imperial transport

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:52.910
were to be leaked...

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:55.430
Why don't we meet halfway

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:56.560
and compromise?

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:57.910
These people

00:24:57.910 --> 00:24:59.870
mostly come from private shipping groups

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:01.330
and have nothing to do with

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:03.590
imperial transport secrets.

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:06.020
Mr. Yu, why don't you

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:06.980
leave these

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.630
non-confidential account books

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:09.630
with us?

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:11.990
This way, everyone wins.

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:13.390
On what grounds?

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:15.100
Give it to him.

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:21.630
So be it.

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:27.710
Take it away.

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:44.910
Are we just letting them

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:46.910
take away that box of account books?

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:47.980
What if all the clues

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:48.830
are in there?

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:50.220
With just these scraps left,

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:51.430
how can we investigate?

00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:52.490
It's alright, Chi.

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:54.630
We're just avoiding confrontation for now,

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:55.030
right?

00:25:57.150 --> 00:26:00.060
This might actually be a good thing.

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:01.710
What do you mean?

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:03.740
Mr. Yu's arrival

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:05.600
must be on Sword King Yu's orders.

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:08.150
I've observed Mr. Tang's actions.

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.590
They're all aimed at
pressuring the Sword King,

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:12.190
forcing him to make mistakes.

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:13.790
Whether those account books

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:14.670
actually contained

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:15.950
the evidence we wanted

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:16.810
was uncertain.

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:19.670
But judging from the Yu family's reaction,

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:20.910
doesn't it prove

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:22.300
there must be
incriminating evidence inside?

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:23.030
Take it away.

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:24.980
As for the box they took,

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:26.700
with Cloud's skills

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:28.670
and some shady tactics,

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:30.430
I'm sure we have ways

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:32.390
to get it back.

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:34.950
Shei,

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:38.470
you've learned some bad habits
from Foxy Tang.

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:40.020
Don't wait for me for dinner.

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:42.220
I'm going to give that guy some trouble.

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:43.390
Be careful, Chi.

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:00.420
This Yu Furen
isn't heading to Sword King City.

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:01.540
Where is he going?

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:21.540
Master.

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:23.220
Is Tang Lici

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:24.950
really that powerful?

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:28.540
Not only did he force you

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:31.260
to nurture the Thousand Curse Needle
with your body,

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:32.520
but he also wounded you

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:33.600
in the illusion.

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:34.780
Today, I should've

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:36.380
sacrificed my physical body

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:39.230
to kill him completely
with the sea of flowers.

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.140
The song is halfway done.

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:42.590
The climax is coming.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.760
All things cannot be rushed.

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:46.220
Besides,

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:47.790
what if you get hurt too?

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:50.690
Who will help me avenge this deep hatred?

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:54.680
I've planned every step

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.260
to finally lure him to this place.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:59.050
How could I not enjoy this game?

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:01.740
The curse bug flower
can trigger his old illness.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:03.350
But if he dies like this,

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.460
wouldn't that be too easy for him?

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:06.460
This time,

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:09.090
I'll make him die while abandoned by all,

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.620
with no one to bury his bones.

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:18.300
Give this to Yu Qifeng.

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:20.440
It's time for the curse bug

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:21.910
raised for Tang Lici

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:24.520
to be put into use.

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:05.220
Why did you only bring back
these account books?

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:06.550
-This voice...
-Madam.

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:08.890
Trying to retrieve all the account books

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.290
would be unreasonable.

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:11.150
Commander Yu,

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:13.090
you're still too merciful.

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:15.900
It seems this matter
will require more effort.

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:17.540
Please tell me, Madam,

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.120
what exactly is the relationship

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.460
between my Master and Wanqiao Chamber?

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:24.060
You don't need to know these things.

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:25.500
You only need to understand

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.000
that whatever the Sword King
wants you to do,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.370
you should do it.

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:29.870
Are these account books

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:31.870
truly evidence planted by Tang Lici

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:33.060
to frame my family,

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.300
as Master said?

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:35.500
Also,

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:37.220
if Tang Lici is truly

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:39.150
the villain selling the Evil Pill,

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:40.350
then why doesn't Master Puzhu

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:42.060
just arrest him?

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:45.040
You don't trust me,

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:47.420
but do you not trust the Sword King?

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:49.710
I wouldn't dare.

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:51.700
Go back now.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.420
Stay alert these days.

00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:55.500
If there's anything else to be done,

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.100
the Sword King will find you.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:58.110
Yes.

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:32.960
It's you.

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:04.670
Mr. Tang!

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:06.830
You sent everyone to look for Chi.

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:07.980
Did something happen?

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:08.580
Stay back.

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:11.500
You're hurt.

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:13.190
I'll go get a doctor.

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:13.980
Stop.

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:17.630
It's just my old illness acting up.

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:18.500
It's nothing.

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:20.670
Don't tell anyone

00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:22.220
about this.

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:24.080
Understand?

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:26.250
But your injury...

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:28.060
Get out.

00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:56.780
Mr. Tang!

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:03.630
I've been looking for you for three years.

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:04.760
Since you're alive,

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:06.830
why didn't you come find me?

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:10.030
I have nothing to do with you.

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:11.390
Why should I go find you?

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:14.500
I'm your fiancé.

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:16.780
Your father made a vow
to the heavens and ancestors

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:17.910
for our engagement.

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:20.300
How do you have nothing to do with me?

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.340
I've torn up the engagement.

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:24.740
Now, I'm Sword King Yu's concubine.

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:26.020
Don't act like a lecher,

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:27.220
putting your hands all over me.

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:27.910
Nonsense!

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:29.670
You are my fiancée.

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:31.570
How could you be with Yu Qi—

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:33.350
How could you be involved

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:34.210
with Yu Qifeng?

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:49.120
I promised your father I would marry you.

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:51.520
No matter what's happening to you now,

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:53.220
I'm taking you with me today.

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:02.170
Bai Suche,

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:04.460
you're poisoning me?

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:04.980
Yes,

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:06.830
you will die here.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:16.850
Madam!

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:21.480
No need to chase after him.

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:23.500
Cloud

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:25.800
isn't so easy to catch.

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:51.909
Butler Sen,

00:34:52.139 --> 00:34:53.540
look there, look there!

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:57.510
-Mr. Chi!
-Chi!

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:03.980
Fang Zhou.

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.760
Fang Zhou.

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:20.430
Fang Zhou!

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:28.100
Fang Zhou.

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:30.580
Fang Zhou!

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:43.430
Fang Zhou,

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:45.290
don't leave again.

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:47.790
I'm about to fulfill

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:49.990
what I promised you.

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:51.060
Lici,

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:52.870
stop fooling yourself.

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:55.310
I'm already dead.

00:36:59.310 --> 00:36:59.950
Fang Zhou,

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:02.440
trust me one more time.

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.000
I always succeed in

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:06.950
what I want to do.

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:09.700
I said I would bring you back,

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:11.500
so I will definitely do it.

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:12.900
I won't break my promise.

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:15.000
Why do you want to save me so badly?

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:16.910
I...

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.200
Your past

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:23.980
was full of killing,

00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:25.140
betrayal,

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:26.450
and destruction.

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.560
You don't want this past,

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:31.310
yet you're not sure

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:32.570
about your own nature,

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:33.180
right?

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:38.310
I don't know.

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:42.660
I don't know.

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:44.230
Fang Zhou,

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:47.030
don't ask me anymore.

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:48.270
Lici,

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:50.880
do you regret it?

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:56.910
Regret?

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:05.570
Saving you?

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:07.990
I don't regret it.

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:53.730
My strength has returned.

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:06.140
Mr. Tang, you're awake.

00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:12.910
Who let you in?

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:15.430
I saw you were injured

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.430
and was very worried about you,

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:18.960
so I gave you some medicine.

00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:21.390
I'm sorry.

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:23.140
I...

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:25.710
Get out.

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:48.670
This medicine

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:50.310
can heal my old wound

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:53.560
and even neutralize the curse bug poison.

00:39:57.490 --> 00:40:00.100
[Marriage Letter]

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:26.710
After the Bai family was massacred,

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:28.240
she suddenly disappeared.

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:30.230
I spent over a year looking for her

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:31.270
to no avail.

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:32.790
Now, she claims to be

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:34.120
Yu Qifeng's concubine.

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:35.430
She even poisoned me.

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:36.580
Tell me...

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:52.980
Have you recovered?

00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:54.910
The remaining poison is gone. I'm fine.

00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:55.430
Good.

00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:58.830
Today, accompany me

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:00.790
to the Qiongtai Banquet.

00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:02.910
Let's not talk about

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:03.910
that Qiongtai appointment now.

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:06.040
Help me analyze this situation first.

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:07.830
Bai Suche is my wife.

00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:09.270
How can I just stand by and watch her

00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:10.180
be with Yu Qifeng?

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:11.140
Just because you like her,

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:12.620
does that mean she must marry you

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:14.270
and can't marry someone else?

00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:14.950
On what grounds?

00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:16.710
Because we were engaged first!

00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:17.660
Since we were engaged,

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:18.660
she belongs to me.

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:20.500
She doesn't belong to anyone.

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:21.660
She is free.

00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:23.870
Even if you, Chi Yun,

00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:25.020
believe yourself to be

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:26.620
a thousand times better than Yu Qifeng,

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:28.710
she still has the right not to choose you.

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:29.100
What?

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:30.580
Can the mighty Cloud

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:32.750
only hide behind parental arrangements

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:33.980
and matchmakers?

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:35.370
Tang Lici,

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:37.500
I've worked for you for a year,

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:38.310
serving you faithfully,

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:39.390
and there hasn't been a single thing

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:41.020
I've done to let you down, right?

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:42.060
Now, instead of speaking up for me,

00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:44.020
you're defending that outsider, Yu Qifeng?

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:45.820
Do you even consider me a friend?

00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:51.660
Friend?

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:55.030
When did I, Tang Lici, ever acknowledge

00:41:55.570 --> 00:41:56.820
that we were friends?

00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:02.790
Fine.

00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:06.310
I'm not worthy of being your friend.

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:06.790
So now,

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:08.390
there's nothing left to say.

00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:10.620
Let's not work together anymore.

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:11.550
Let's part ways!

00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:12.410
Chi!

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:18.540
What?

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:21.240
Do you want to leave too?

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:25.020
She vanished without a trace a year ago.

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:25.750
A year later,

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:28.500
she just happened
to appear in Sword King City,

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:29.830
so you suspect Bai Suche

00:42:29.830 --> 00:42:30.830
works for Liu Yan.

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:33.580
You're worried that Chi Yun
is too impulsive

00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:34.660
and getting in too deep.

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:35.910
You're afraid he'll get hurt,

00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:37.910
so you deliberately drove him away.

00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:39.590
Desperate times

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:41.640
call for desperate measures.

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:43.620
Chi Yun is simple-minded.

00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:45.890
Emotions cloud judgment.

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:47.230
If he finds out

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:49.890
that Bai Suche is connected
to the Fengliu Shop,

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:52.350
he'll throw everything down

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:54.660
to take Bai Suche away.

00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:56.350
Rather than letting him

00:42:56.350 --> 00:42:57.680
fall into another trap,

00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:59.760
it's better to let anger

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:01.610
fill his mind first.

00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:05.000
It's better than letting him
be manipulated now.

00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:09.140
I'm afraid the one whose heart is troubled

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:10.430
isn't just Chi Yun.

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.630
You've been off

00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:17.550
since you saw Liu Yan yesterday.

00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:18.910
You're losing focus.

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:21.060
If this continues, you'll lose.

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:21.710
Is that so?

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:24.980
Liu Yan might win,

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:27.020
but Tang Lici

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:29.060
will never lose.
