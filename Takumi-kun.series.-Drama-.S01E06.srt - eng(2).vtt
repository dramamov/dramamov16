WEBVTT

00:00:12.155 --> 00:00:13.355
Are you okay?

00:00:14.385 --> 00:00:15.385
Yeah...

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:28.185
Train tickets?

00:00:29.545 --> 00:00:30.545
Yeah.

00:00:31.415 --> 00:00:33.675
My mother asked me to go back
to visit the family grave.

00:00:35.675 --> 00:00:37.175
Visit a grave?

00:00:38.285 --> 00:00:39.285
Whose grave?

00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:45.575
Hayama Naoto.

00:00:48.605 --> 00:00:49.805
My older brother.

00:00:54.395 --> 00:00:56.165
He'd be 22 if he were still alive.

00:00:58.035 --> 00:00:59.135
Three years ago,

00:01:00.265 --> 00:01:02.315
he passed away in the hospital.

00:01:07.315 --> 00:01:08.795
What was his illness?

00:01:11.465 --> 00:01:12.465
His heart.

00:01:14.515 --> 00:01:15.815
It was congenital.

00:01:17.815 --> 00:01:18.915
But...

00:01:19.595 --> 00:01:21.545
he was still able to go to P.E. class.

00:01:22.035 --> 00:01:23.375
I didn't think it was very serious.

00:01:29.845 --> 00:01:30.675
Gii...

00:01:35.775 --> 00:01:37.345
You said it before, didn't you?

00:01:37.965 --> 00:01:40.395
That I'm terrible at expressing myself.

00:01:41.545 --> 00:01:42.645
Huh...?

00:01:43.075 --> 00:01:44.175
Either that,

00:01:44.675 --> 00:01:46.735
or I have human-touch aversion.

00:01:48.095 --> 00:01:51.565
Human-touch aversion?

00:01:53.325 --> 00:01:55.005
When you pointed that out, Gii,

00:01:56.875 --> 00:01:58.235
I was honestly surprised.

00:02:01.815 --> 00:02:03.405
Because everyone else would just say

00:02:05.075 --> 00:02:06.625
I was a weirdo,

00:02:07.525 --> 00:02:09.155
or that I hated people,

00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:11.395
and then avoid me.

00:02:17.725 --> 00:02:18.925
As for why

00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:21.105
I became like that...

00:02:29.475 --> 00:02:30.675
The reason is...

00:02:32.335 --> 00:02:34.205
my brother who passed away.

00:02:41.855 --> 00:02:42.855
Takumi.

00:02:43.535 --> 00:02:45.315
It's okay. If it's too painful...

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:53.555
I want you to hear it, Gii.

00:03:01.525 --> 00:03:02.525
That day,

00:03:04.395 --> 00:03:07.085
for some reason,
my brother snuck out of the hospital.

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:10.655
All day,

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:13.785
in a rainy forest,

00:03:15.115 --> 00:03:16.215
without even an umbrella,

00:03:17.045 --> 00:03:18.435
he wandered aimlessly.

00:03:21.555 --> 00:03:22.655
My brother...

00:03:25.485 --> 00:03:26.685
He looked a lot like you, Gii.

00:03:30.175 --> 00:03:32.085
Though you're complete opposites in personality.

00:03:33.185 --> 00:03:34.295
He was a great student.

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:36.465
Popular with everyone.

00:03:38.175 --> 00:03:39.885
So handsome,

00:03:40.245 --> 00:03:43.175
you wouldn't believe we were brothers.

00:03:44.835 --> 00:03:48.575
My parents' attention was always on my brother.

00:03:50.815 --> 00:03:52.075
They doted on him completely.

00:03:55.175 --> 00:03:58.805
Were your parents cold to you?

00:04:00.665 --> 00:04:02.125
How should I put it...

00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:06.065
My parents were indifferent to me.

00:04:07.915 --> 00:04:09.835
Whether I aced a test

00:04:10.755 --> 00:04:11.955
or got a zero,

00:04:12.465 --> 00:04:13.665
their reaction was always the same.

00:04:16.605 --> 00:04:17.985
I can't believe it.

00:04:18.775 --> 00:04:20.485
What kind of parents are they?

00:04:20.515 --> 00:04:21.385
Yeah...

00:04:22.805 --> 00:04:24.565
So my feelings

00:04:25.225 --> 00:04:26.485
never reached them.

00:04:29.095 --> 00:04:30.415
Being truly scolded by them,

00:04:31.295 --> 00:04:32.495
or truly praised...

00:04:33.445 --> 00:04:35.045
I have no memory of that ever happening.

00:04:37.555 --> 00:04:39.475
The one who occupied their hearts

00:04:40.915 --> 00:04:42.285
was always my brother.

00:04:45.935 --> 00:04:47.135
Even though we lived together,

00:04:48.425 --> 00:04:49.955
there was no place for me in their hearts.

00:04:53.945 --> 00:04:55.145
How could they...

00:04:56.515 --> 00:04:57.715
That's why

00:04:58.815 --> 00:05:00.915
my brother became my savior.

00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:05.215
He was the only one

00:05:06.295 --> 00:05:07.755
who would listen to me seriously.

00:05:12.135 --> 00:05:13.555
He was a good brother, wasn't he?

00:05:15.485 --> 00:05:16.485
Yeah.

00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:20.685
He was a good brother.

00:05:25.915 --> 00:05:26.915
But...

00:05:29.235 --> 00:05:30.935
at some point, he started acting strange.

00:05:35.745 --> 00:05:37.605
The year my brother started junior high,

00:05:39.185 --> 00:05:41.125
I was only in the second grade.

00:05:42.035 --> 00:05:43.035
Back then,

00:05:43.515 --> 00:05:46.505
I barely even understood the difference
between boys and girls.

00:05:49.175 --> 00:05:50.175
From then on,

00:05:51.505 --> 00:05:52.505
my brother...

00:05:52.955 --> 00:05:55.995
would try to touch me
all over any chance he got.

00:06:01.585 --> 00:06:03.225
You didn't fight back?

00:06:06.175 --> 00:06:07.375
No.

00:06:10.515 --> 00:06:11.715
I couldn't.

00:06:13.705 --> 00:06:14.705
Because...

00:06:15.155 --> 00:06:17.735
my brother was supposed to be my savior.

00:06:20.875 --> 00:06:22.205
It was only when my brother

00:06:23.245 --> 00:06:24.965
mentioned me

00:06:26.195 --> 00:06:28.395
that my parents would pay any attention to me.

00:06:31.615 --> 00:06:32.615
But...

00:06:34.525 --> 00:06:36.385
my brother took advantage of that.

00:06:41.775 --> 00:06:42.775
And then...

00:06:45.345 --> 00:06:46.345
that day came.

00:06:57.005 --> 00:06:58.005
Just like today,

00:06:59.545 --> 00:07:00.985
it was a dreary, rainy day.

00:07:04.625 --> 00:07:06.145
My brother had a fever that day,

00:07:07.625 --> 00:07:09.095
so he was home from school.

00:07:12.075 --> 00:07:13.385
My mom had just

00:07:15.295 --> 00:07:17.875
stepped out to buy groceries for dinner.

00:07:23.165 --> 00:07:25.005
My brother took that chance

00:07:28.315 --> 00:07:30.515
to drag me into his bed.

00:07:33.915 --> 00:07:34.915
But then,

00:07:36.585 --> 00:07:38.385
my mom, who had forgotten her wallet,

00:07:39.355 --> 00:07:40.615
suddenly came back.

00:07:44.245 --> 00:07:45.245
And what do you think my brother

00:07:45.925 --> 00:07:47.125
did?

00:07:52.015 --> 00:07:55.475
He wasn't going to cover for me, was he?

00:08:01.045 --> 00:08:02.695
He said I seduced him.

00:08:05.615 --> 00:08:06.615
My brother,

00:08:07.985 --> 00:08:09.375
even with tears in his eyes,

00:08:09.785 --> 00:08:10.985
pleaded his case to my mother.

00:08:15.315 --> 00:08:19.125
My feelings for my brother, in that instant,

00:08:20.935 --> 00:08:22.905
shattered.

00:08:26.455 --> 00:08:29.735
My father and mother,

00:08:31.595 --> 00:08:33.725
without asking for my side of the story,

00:08:35.245 --> 00:08:37.325
took me to the psychiatric ward of the university hospital.

00:08:41.335 --> 00:08:42.825
We came back quickly, though.

00:08:47.855 --> 00:08:48.855
So...

00:08:50.085 --> 00:08:51.085
Yeah...

00:08:52.925 --> 00:08:54.555
My parents must have realized something was wrong.

00:08:56.055 --> 00:08:58.075
That I wasn't the one with the problem.

00:09:00.225 --> 00:09:02.215
My brother was hospitalized.

00:09:05.685 --> 00:09:06.685
But...

00:09:08.235 --> 00:09:10.675
by then, I didn't care about anything anymore.

00:09:14.265 --> 00:09:16.175
Giving up on everything

00:09:18.425 --> 00:09:23.465
was how I learned to survive.

00:09:29.895 --> 00:09:31.095
Do you hate him?

00:09:32.555 --> 00:09:33.555
Even now...

00:09:36.415 --> 00:09:37.415
I guess so.

00:09:40.035 --> 00:09:41.035
But...

00:09:45.275 --> 00:09:46.095
Gii...

00:09:48.685 --> 00:09:51.875
Do you hate me now?

00:09:56.245 --> 00:09:57.245
You...

00:09:59.035 --> 00:10:00.735
Didn't I tell you I love you?

00:10:04.935 --> 00:10:11.605
I'm not worth treasuring like this.

00:10:15.665 --> 00:10:16.665
Takumi.

00:10:17.235 --> 00:10:19.265
You really are a terrible judge of character.

00:10:29.075 --> 00:10:30.075
I love you,

00:10:30.875 --> 00:10:31.875
Takumi.

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:09.375
After my brother passed away,

00:11:10.315 --> 00:11:13.855
this is the first time I've come to this place.

00:11:20.145 --> 00:11:21.145
That person...

00:11:21.855 --> 00:11:24.805
He was a nurse from the hospital
where my brother was staying.

00:11:30.795 --> 00:11:32.485
He said that on the day my brother died,

00:11:32.965 --> 00:11:34.675
while he was wandering in the rain,

00:11:35.245 --> 00:11:36.485
he was actually looking for me.

00:11:37.685 --> 00:11:40.755
And that nurse was the one who found him.

00:11:43.525 --> 00:11:47.525
He said that before he died,
my brother kept deliriously saying,

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:50.385
"Takumi, where are you?"

00:11:50.855 --> 00:11:51.855
"Takumi."

00:11:52.005 --> 00:11:53.905
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry."

00:12:00.895 --> 00:12:01.895
My brother...

00:12:02.675 --> 00:12:04.465
He wanted to tell me, didn't he?

00:12:05.775 --> 00:12:06.775
About what happened that day...

00:12:07.795 --> 00:12:08.795
He always...

00:12:09.215 --> 00:12:10.745
always regretted it.

00:12:19.725 --> 00:12:20.725
Brother...

00:12:21.255 --> 00:12:22.455
I can finally

00:12:22.815 --> 00:12:24.175
move on.

00:12:26.365 --> 00:12:27.565
I can

00:12:28.075 --> 00:12:29.665
love someone again.

00:13:19.685 --> 00:13:20.885
Hey, Yamashita.

00:13:21.335 --> 00:13:23.745
What are you doing, dragging Yoshizawa out here?

00:13:23.995 --> 00:13:24.995
Ah, Takabayashi.

00:13:25.705 --> 00:13:27.285
Oh, no, it's just...

00:13:27.845 --> 00:13:28.845
You still have

00:13:29.335 --> 00:13:30.695
that goody-two-shoes look.

00:13:30.695 --> 00:13:31.855
But you've got quite a mouth on you.

00:13:33.055 --> 00:13:34.925
But that contrast is also part of your charm.

00:13:35.295 --> 00:13:37.515
My beautiful Schauspielerin.

00:13:38.875 --> 00:13:40.585
I can't recall your name,

00:13:41.075 --> 00:13:43.315
but I remember that overconfident attitude of yours.

00:13:46.755 --> 00:13:49.485
I believe I told you to be more respectful to your seniors.

00:13:51.755 --> 00:13:53.895
- Hey!
- Let's go, Takabayashi-kun.

00:13:54.325 --> 00:13:55.405
- Wait, Yoshizawa!
- Yoshizawa.

00:13:55.435 --> 00:13:57.235
We're not done talking yet.

00:13:57.305 --> 00:13:58.295
Yeah, yeah.

00:13:58.815 --> 00:14:00.265
We haven't even gotten to the main point.

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:03.535
Yoshizawa-kun, was it?

00:14:04.205 --> 00:14:05.305
Excuse me,

00:14:05.365 --> 00:14:06.465
but could you step aside for a moment?

00:14:06.485 --> 00:14:07.485
Huh?

00:14:09.855 --> 00:14:10.855
That thing from last time...

00:14:11.625 --> 00:14:13.275
I can't forget it.

00:14:13.875 --> 00:14:14.975
Kissing you.

00:14:15.685 --> 00:14:17.365
We still have unfinished business.

00:14:18.555 --> 00:14:20.595
Hey! What do you think you're doing?!

00:14:20.595 --> 00:14:21.115
What was that for?

00:14:21.115 --> 00:14:23.655
- Yoshizawa! Do you know what you're doing?!
- What do you think you're doing?!

00:14:23.735 --> 00:14:25.295
- Not before the school placement exams...
- Shut up!

00:14:27.685 --> 00:14:28.685
Stop right there.

00:14:28.925 --> 00:14:30.645
I'm a second-degree black belt in karate.

00:14:30.965 --> 00:14:31.965
Is that so?

00:14:32.585 --> 00:14:33.955
Then I won't hold back.

00:14:35.005 --> 00:14:36.025
Itami...!

00:14:36.345 --> 00:14:37.615
Itami... Itami!

00:14:41.985 --> 00:14:42.845
My tooth...

00:14:43.495 --> 00:14:47.085
From now on, stay away from Takabayashi-kun.

00:14:47.645 --> 00:14:48.645
I get it.

00:14:48.845 --> 00:14:50.605
You get that, Itami?

00:14:50.605 --> 00:14:51.665
Let's go to the nurse's office.

00:14:51.855 --> 00:14:53.615
- Let's go to the nurse's office.
- My tooth broke...

00:15:00.075 --> 00:15:01.285
I give up.

00:15:01.375 --> 00:15:02.175
Huh?

00:15:03.225 --> 00:15:04.565
The thing is...

00:15:04.765 --> 00:15:05.975
I'm terrified of the dentist.

00:15:15.935 --> 00:15:16.935
Let's go.

00:15:20.255 --> 00:15:21.455
Yoshizawa.

00:15:23.765 --> 00:15:24.965
Takabayashi-kun.

00:15:27.225 --> 00:15:28.425
Thank you.

00:15:33.955 --> 00:15:36.725
Guess we had to fight to become friends.

00:15:38.325 --> 00:15:40.675
I wonder how those two are doing...

00:15:57.285 --> 00:15:58.485
Hey, Takumi.

00:16:01.925 --> 00:16:02.605
Gii.

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:06.625
You're here.

00:16:08.125 --> 00:16:09.125
Takumi.

00:16:09.345 --> 00:16:10.545
Let's go on a date.

00:16:11.475 --> 00:16:12.475
A date?

00:16:13.285 --> 00:16:14.935
We agreed to on the phone, remember?

00:16:16.195 --> 00:16:17.675
I wanted to meet up with you...

00:16:17.785 --> 00:16:19.115
somewhere other than school.

00:16:21.525 --> 00:16:22.325
Yeah.

00:17:00.815 --> 00:17:02.065
Can't sleep?

00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:05.415
Yeah.

00:17:08.015 --> 00:17:09.115
By the way...

00:17:10.785 --> 00:17:11.885
Thank you for today.

00:17:14.065 --> 00:17:15.065
Don't mention it.

00:17:15.155 --> 00:17:16.155
It was nothing.

00:17:16.555 --> 00:17:18.695
You don't have to thank me.

00:17:20.015 --> 00:17:21.015
No.

00:17:23.595 --> 00:17:24.795
I was really glad.

00:17:48.025 --> 00:17:49.475
Because I couldn't forgive...

00:17:52.765 --> 00:17:53.965
Huh?

00:17:56.195 --> 00:18:00.275
What he tried to do to Takabayashi-kun.

00:18:16.045 --> 00:18:17.245
Yoshizawa.

00:18:24.315 --> 00:18:25.515
I like you.

00:18:30.605 --> 00:18:32.185
I like Yoshizawa.

00:19:28.815 --> 00:19:30.875
How did it come to this?

00:19:35.425 --> 00:19:36.625
Because I'm...

00:19:37.615 --> 00:19:39.955
in love with Arata-san.

00:19:42.375 --> 00:19:45.385
I don't recall accepting your confession.

00:19:48.975 --> 00:19:49.975
Arata-san.

00:19:53.385 --> 00:19:55.245
Do you know about Artemis?

00:19:57.615 --> 00:19:59.315
The goddess of the moon, right?

00:20:03.015 --> 00:20:04.585
Your name, Arata-san.

00:20:06.635 --> 00:20:08.365
If you write it in Roman letters,

00:20:09.915 --> 00:20:11.015
it's an anagram...

00:20:12.565 --> 00:20:14.525
for Artemis.

00:20:18.185 --> 00:20:19.285
It's so beautiful...

00:20:34.885 --> 00:20:36.465
What's so beautiful about it?

00:20:47.595 --> 00:20:48.595
What's the matter, Takumi?

00:20:48.675 --> 00:20:49.675
Aren't you going to sleep?

00:20:57.685 --> 00:20:58.905
Hey, Gii.

00:20:59.905 --> 00:21:01.705
During summer break...

00:21:02.385 --> 00:21:03.885
let's go on another date.

00:21:04.885 --> 00:21:05.955
Huh?

00:21:07.535 --> 00:21:08.735
I want to go somewhere with you,

00:21:09.095 --> 00:21:10.295
just the two of us.

00:21:15.745 --> 00:21:16.845
That's a good idea.

00:21:25.665 --> 00:21:26.935
It's a little cliché, but...

00:21:27.265 --> 00:21:28.465
how about the beach?

00:21:30.305 --> 00:21:31.305
Sounds great!

00:21:46.925 --> 00:21:49.575
Takabayashi-kun,
you should eat some of your carrots.

00:21:50.295 --> 00:21:51.675
I said no.

00:21:52.095 --> 00:21:53.505
I hate carrots.

00:21:54.645 --> 00:21:56.915
But it's a waste to leave them all.

00:21:57.565 --> 00:21:59.205
They're good for you. Come on.

00:21:59.625 --> 00:22:01.075
Just have one bite.

00:22:04.565 --> 00:22:06.095
Come on, say 'ahh'.

00:22:06.895 --> 00:22:08.095
No way.

00:22:10.985 --> 00:22:11.985
Come on.

00:22:12.065 --> 00:22:13.065
Then how about this...

00:22:13.855 --> 00:22:16.265
You feed it to me with your mouth, Yoshizawa.

00:22:17.485 --> 00:22:18.185
Huh?

00:22:18.605 --> 00:22:19.725
U-um...

00:22:20.115 --> 00:22:21.315
- U-um...
- Okay.

00:22:21.395 --> 00:22:22.765
I mean...

00:22:24.015 --> 00:22:25.115
Takabayashi-kun...

00:22:25.815 --> 00:22:26.895
- Come on, hurry up.
- Hey, people are staring!

00:22:26.895 --> 00:22:28.695
Everyone's watching us, Takabayashi-kun.

00:22:53.275 --> 00:22:54.275
Arata-san.

00:22:55.355 --> 00:22:56.765
You again?

00:22:57.005 --> 00:22:59.125
I bought some bread. Want to share?

00:22:59.805 --> 00:23:01.135
Personal space.

00:23:01.285 --> 00:23:03.175
Come on, we've slept together.

00:23:03.175 --> 00:23:05.195
That has nothing to do with it.

00:23:05.645 --> 00:23:07.725
No, I don't get it at all.

00:23:08.385 --> 00:23:09.385
Anyway...

00:23:09.755 --> 00:23:11.345
Arata-san, do you have any plans for summer break?

00:23:12.075 --> 00:23:13.615
Why do you ask?

00:23:13.955 --> 00:23:14.685
No reason.

00:23:14.685 --> 00:23:16.825
I was just wondering if we could hang out.

00:23:16.865 --> 00:23:19.185
Why on earth would I go out with you?

00:23:19.185 --> 00:23:21.225
Besides, I've got the Inter-High tournament.
I don't have time for that.

00:23:21.275 --> 00:23:22.275
That's not what I meant.

00:23:22.665 --> 00:23:24.015
I meant, like, after the tournament is over.

00:23:24.185 --> 00:23:25.125
Like I said...

00:23:25.125 --> 00:23:27.635
Why on earth would I go out with you?

00:23:27.705 --> 00:23:29.755
Because we slept together.

00:23:29.755 --> 00:23:31.925
That has nothing to do with it!

00:23:31.975 --> 00:23:33.705
So I don't get it at all.

00:23:34.865 --> 00:23:35.965
Why is that?

00:23:36.975 --> 00:23:38.255
When I'm with him,

00:23:39.445 --> 00:23:41.755
my heart feels so full.

00:23:45.095 --> 00:23:47.625
The one person who can give me what I want most.

00:23:49.705 --> 00:23:50.805
Arata-san.

00:23:52.035 --> 00:23:53.135
I love you more than anyone.

00:23:55.515 --> 00:23:57.565
We have patrols before lunch.

00:23:58.075 --> 00:24:00.175
Don't you think we have too much work?

00:24:01.505 --> 00:24:04.115
You can change the rules
when you become chairman.

00:24:04.425 --> 00:24:07.455
I'm not as popular as Shibata-senpai.

00:24:07.785 --> 00:24:09.745
- You think so?
- I do.

00:24:13.435 --> 00:24:14.845
Well, I for one...

00:24:15.395 --> 00:24:16.595
would vote for you.

00:24:21.085 --> 00:24:22.755
If that wasn't totally biased,

00:24:22.755 --> 00:24:25.125
I'd be genuinely grateful.

00:24:26.655 --> 00:24:28.755
Of course I'm mixing business with pleasure.

00:24:55.275 --> 00:24:56.275
Takumi.

00:24:56.565 --> 00:24:57.565
Another roll.

00:24:58.165 --> 00:24:59.585
This is your fifth one already.

00:25:00.005 --> 00:25:01.755
- You're eating too much.
- I told you, didn't I?

00:25:02.155 --> 00:25:04.235
My stomach is a bottomless pit.

00:25:04.605 --> 00:25:05.605
Sorry, but no.

00:25:08.185 --> 00:25:09.185
Takumi...

00:25:24.105 --> 00:25:26.825
Ah, Gii! I said no!

00:25:27.625 --> 00:25:29.205
Geez...

00:25:30.065 --> 00:25:31.735
I'm never going on a date with you again, Gii.

00:25:33.175 --> 00:25:35.175
If you love bread so much,
why don't you go to France?

00:25:36.165 --> 00:25:37.165
France...?

00:25:37.405 --> 00:25:39.235
You could just go to France
and eat all the bread you want.

00:25:40.815 --> 00:25:42.625
But I want to be with you, Takumi.

00:25:42.835 --> 00:25:43.745
Then give the roll back.

00:25:43.755 --> 00:25:45.695
But bread tastes best
when I eat it with you, Takumi.
