[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.940
[Episode 10]

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.890
Liu Yan may win sometimes,

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:33.680
but I, Tang Lici,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.550
never lose.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.509
Set your heart at ease

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.680
about your vengeance—

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.350
my word is my bond.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.160
You say I'm not worthy to be your friend?

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.390
As if I care!

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.450
I've got my own wife to get back to.

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.370
Can we just leave now?

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.710
You—

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.950
You're still

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:01.840
not leaving?

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.130
After everything he said,

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.590
you're still not leaving?

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.579
Could it be…

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.430
he doesn't really see me as a friend?

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.060
In his eyes,

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.180
am I just holding him back?

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:42.210
Sure,

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.280
Foxy Tang is brilliantly clever,

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.560
but I—

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.710
I'm also…

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.600
You, Foxy Tang, may be brilliant,

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.870
and you're always

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.280
so composed.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.210
Why are you acting so odd today?

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.190
Unless…

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.210
Are you saying one thing
but meaning another—

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.290
are you actually worried about me?

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.590
Fine, I'll reluctantly forgive you then.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:18.470
Chi,

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.400
how important you are to Mr. Tang—

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.440
we all know it.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.960
His old injury flared up again;

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.510
that's why he spoke so harshly.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.240
His old injury flared up again?

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.090
Yes.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.920
See? I knew he couldn't manage without me.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.280
Wanqiao Chamber has obtained

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.430
the ship guild's ledgers.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.360
I fear our secret

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.329
won't remain hidden much longer.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.190
No wonder only our most trusted allies

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.250
are present today.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.360
The banquet, which will serve
as the public tribunal, is about to begin.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.490
Why hasn't the Sword King arrived yet?

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.360
Master, you summoned me in such haste—

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.750
has something happened?

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.000
Take this command token as your authority,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.240
and transport the cargo
from the dockside warehouse

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.910
out of the city immediately.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:16.630
Leave now.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:19.870
Master...

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:21.870
What is it?

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.490
The people from Wanqiao Chamber
are spreading rumors

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.720
that you and several allied sect leaders

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.010
are implicated in the Evil Pill scandal.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.250
What exactly is this cargo

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.070
that you're in such a hurry to transport?

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.680
This is a venomous scheme
orchestrated by Tang Lici—

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.630
how can you believe such lies?

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:33.120
Go, now!

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.270
You bastard!

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:40.510
Master,

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.360
I'm only perplexed—

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.720
why the rush to conceal these goods?

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.190
You have always taught me

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.270
to put Sword King City
first in all things.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.070
Yet now,

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.830
it seems the city

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.630
faces utter and irreversible ruin.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.120
I have

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.090
never doubted you, Master.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.930
I only beg for an explanation.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:25.510
It is my fault

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.070
for not clarifying earlier,

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.530
allowing you to be misled.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.880
Tang Lici is cunning and treacherous.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.870
First, he used Jiang Qingyu's death

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:33.390
to drive a wedge

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.990
between me and Master Puzhu.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.270
Then, under the guise of business,

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.000
he obtained confidential ledgers,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.120
seeking to infiltrate his influence

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.360
into the imperial transport system.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.630
Had I not uncovered

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.190
his plot to frame me in advance

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.800
and made preparations,

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.830
both Sword King City and I

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.250
would have been utterly disgraced.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.250
So that is why you asked me to...

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.130
Who does not wish to walk with integrity?

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.520
Yet I have been trapped,

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.170
unable to prove my innocence.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:05.600
Rise now.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:07.170
Come here.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.070
Master.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:10.510
Furen.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:14.430
Master,

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:16.290
this...

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.450
this is the first time
you've called me that.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.230
There are no outsiders here.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.040
You may address me differently now.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.340
I will not fail in this mission.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.680
For Sword King City,

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.630
for the jianghu—
I will root out the villains and traitors

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.690
and see Tang Lici brought to justice.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.070
Furen.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.570
Father.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:32.750
Lici,

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:34.450
I heard from Liu Yan

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.040
that you shattered
all his curse bug altars.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.860
It was all for nothing.

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:40.870
They were

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.670
meant to be gifts for you,

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.970
and now they're destroyed.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:48.350
Is that true?

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:50.570
Let me see this one.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.490
This is still lovely, really.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:08.930
Lici,

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.050
if the carving is flawed,
it can be mended.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:13.490
If it's beyond repair,

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.070
we can begin anew.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.520
Who among us is without fault?

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.360
But to recognize our errors
and make amends—that is true virtue.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.870
Go and apologize to Liu Yan.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.000
He will forgive you.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.179
The banquet is about to begin.

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:40.049
It's time we set off.

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:41.549
Tell me—

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.440
are we born exactly

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:44.810
as who we are?

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:49.530
Or are we like this wooden puppet,

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:50.930
carved stroke by stroke,

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.000
shaped into what we become

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.510
by all we've endured?

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.330
For the Bodhisattva to become a monster,

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.330
I bear undeniable responsibility.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.220
Then who bears the blame for me

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:03.550
becoming Soul Breaker Shen?

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:08.170
I can only forgive myself

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:09.690
if I kill Liu Yan.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.520
No, you won't.

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:23.050
You, who caused the death

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.830
of a loved one
through your own helplessness—

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:26.830
even revenge

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:29.270
won't make you forgive yourself.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:35.650
Shen,

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:38.630
let's go.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.750
The Sword King has arrived!

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:04.630
All hail the Sword King!

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:09.210
Sword King,

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:10.160
something feels off.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:10.870
What is it?

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.180
They called this
a public tribunal for Jiang Qingyu,

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.970
but the hall is filled
with only our own allies.

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.300
Hardly any of the major sect leaders
are present.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.300
A bunch of fair-weather followers!

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.440
They'd scramble over each other

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.480
to curry Sword King's favor
in better times,

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.160
but now that Sword King is facing trouble,

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.440
they've all vanished.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:25.730
Exactly!

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:26.800
That's right!

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.770
What are you panicking for?

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:33.030
Tonight, only one person

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:34.150
needs to know

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.380
Tang Lici is the murderer.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:38.390
As long as he's here,

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:39.480
the stage is set.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.260
Master Puzhu has arrived as well.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.050
Please, take a seat.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:09.890
This shipment

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.750
must leave tonight,
no matter what.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:12.480
Understood.

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.140
Today's host

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:19.440
is not me,

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.180
but the Master of Wanqiao Chamber—
Tang Lici.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.180
He paid handsomely to borrow my Qiongtai,

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:27.320
claiming

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:29.500
he wishes to reveal the truth
about Jiang Qingyu

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:30.500
to all of you.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:31.870
Sword King,

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.200
how is it that I heard

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.660
Jiang Qingyu was already dead?

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:39.630
I must admit,

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:42.550
this was my failure.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.090
Jiang Qingyu had returned from Yanmen

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:46.870
and was securely imprisoned

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:47.800
in Yu's Dungeon,

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.640
awaiting trial by the Sword Alliance.

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:52.080
But then,

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:53.720
just yesterday,

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:55.610
he was suddenly silenced—

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.550
the dungeon was set on fire

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.150
to burn the body and destroy all evidence.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.280
To my astonishment,

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.670
not a single clue remains.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.780
The Yu's Dungeon is heavily guarded.

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:06.870
How could an assassin

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:08.360
slip in unnoticed

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.090
to kill and cover their tracks?

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.240
That day,

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.390
Master Puzhu and I

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:16.790
happened to encounter the killer

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:18.030
fleeing the scene.

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:19.920
It was none other than Soul Breaker Shen—

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.310
the Shisan Tower assassin

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:22.440
brought into his employ by the master

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.670
of Wanqiao Chamber

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:25.910
with a lavish sum.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:28.900
Soul Breaker Shen.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:30.590
One wonders

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:33.200
whether Mr. Tang hosts this banquet today

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.080
to make feeble excuses,

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:36.600
or to...

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.820
That day, everything happened too fast.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.390
I did not capture the assassin,

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:43.450
so I cannot confirm

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.080
that Mr. Tang

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.850
ordered the murder.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:54.590
Master Puzhu,
your compassion does you honor,

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:55.680
yet one must remember:

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.560
appearances can be deceiving!

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.080
Master Puzhu,

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.080
we implore you to discern the truth
in its minute detail!

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:07.010
Master Puzhu, we implore you
to discern the truth in its minute detail!

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.080
If the Sword Alliance wishes

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.340
to know my true nature,

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:11.430
why rely on others to speak for me?

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.120
You misunderstand, Mr. Tang.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.970
What kind of person you are can,

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:29.360
of course, only be defined

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.360
by yourself.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.050
Please, take a seat.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:39.960
Esteemed guests,

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.120
allow me to present tonight's host:

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:44.050
the current emperor's brother-in-law,

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:46.180
disciple of Head Fang of Zhoudi Tower—

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:47.390
Mr. Tang.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:49.900
Shall we all

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.700
raise a glass in his honor?

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:02.270
A man of Mr. Tang's refined tastes

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.730
would hardly find common wine worthy.

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:06.510
This cup I offer

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.030
is called "When in Rome."

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.390
Mr. Tang, won't you indulge us?

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:12.630
Please.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.440
Has no one ever told you, Sword King,

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.860
that your skill in administering a curse

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:34.010
is rather amateurish?

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:42.750
This curse

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:45.610
is called "Truth Teller."

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:47.910
Once consumed,

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:49.030
one cannot help

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.000
but answer any question truthfully.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.720
Mr. Tang is famously eloquent—

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.180
beyond ordinary measure.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.500
If we are to uncover

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.390
the truth I seek tonight,

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:58.670
you must

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.360
drink this cup.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.700
Since that is the case,

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.240
I shall

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.170
grant the Sword King his wish tonight.

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:17.320
This wine, of course, must be drunk—

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:18.080
but

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.210
not by me alone.

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:47.160
My cup is already empty.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.380
Now, Sword King Yu,

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.780
it is your turn to drink yours.

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:06.750
Naturally.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.960
Come, everyone—let us drink.

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:34.000
Your bravery knows no bounds, Sword King.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:51.390
I went through hell

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:52.550
to get these ledgers,

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:53.750
and now Foxy Tang goes off to feast

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:54.720
without me—

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.440
stuck here staring

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.040
at these damn books instead.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.710
If they're running a covert operation,

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:06.520
the Yu family would have taken care

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:07.579
to leave no traces.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:09.069
That means we need

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.599
to look for clues
hidden between the lines.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.440
I really admire

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.400
your thoroughness.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.180
You keep at it—

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:17.839
I'm stepping out for some air.

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:34.920
Miss Shei, take a look—

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.090
does anything seem off to you?

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:39.830
These records are irregular.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.000
Look here—

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.240
between June and September,

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.760
when the ships passed
through cities along the Huaihe River,

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.200
the manifest lists

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:50.070
"Ruyi Fruit,"
a specialty of Sword King City.

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:52.110
But Ruyi Fruit

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:54.130
really is a local specialty
of Sword King City.

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:55.860
What's suspicious about that?

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.950
Ruyi trees bloom in May

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:00.510
and bear fruit in September.

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:03.170
The fruit isn't ready
for market until October.

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:04.030
If the ship

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:06.550
left Sword King City in June,

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:07.790
there's no way

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:09.320
it was carrying Ruyi Fruit.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.330
Miss Shei, you're so sharp—

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.640
no wonder Mr. Tang

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:14.840
keeps you by his side.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.160
If we can trace

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:16.920
where this merchant ship

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:17.720
unloaded its cargo,

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.850
we'll find our lead.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.240
Tang Bing,

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:21.150
take notes.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:22.370
Right away.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.020
Tonight, I am your host.

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.150
And for all present,

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.130
I have reserved a far finer wine.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.480
Soul Breaker Shen!

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.680
What is he doing here?

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:42.410
Soul Breaker Shen!

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.970
How dare you show your face, you murderer!

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.440
If Sword King Yu

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:50.270
has the nerve to be here,
why shouldn't I?

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:53.350
The truth cannot stay buried forever,

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:56.610
and fine wine isn't the Sword King's
exclusive privilege.

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:08.810
Aren't you going to drink?

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:57.060
During my time in Yanmen,
I encountered the Evil Pill.

00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.590
Had the Sword King not intervened,

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:01.450
the jianghu world might
have descended into chaos.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:02.830
So with this jar of wine,

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:03.920
I toast

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:06.470
to Sword King—

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:08.240
for his monumental contributions

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.280
to the jianghu,

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:10.880
and his towering stature

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.340
in the martial arts world.

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.600
May everyone

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:15.710
join forces wholeheartedly

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:18.750
to eradicate the forces
behind the Evil Pill

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:22.310
and grant peace
to the souls of the unjustly slain.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.260
Why did he pour it out?

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:31.110
Do you dare to drink?

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:31.840
I don't dare.

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:33.040
I dare not drink.

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:53.420
He drank it.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:11.240
Now that we've drunk this cup,

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.000
Mr. Tang, it's time to answer

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.200
the truth

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:14.920
I demand—

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.790
a matter even more destabilizing

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:18.520
to the jianghu than Jiang Qingyu's death.

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.160
On behalf of all heroes under heaven,

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.640
I must

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:24.250
ask you this damning question—

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.860
do not take offense, Mr. Tang.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.510
Was Head Fang's death

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.000
your doing?

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.330
Is this the tactic that person taught you?

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.300
Will Mr. Tang not answer?

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:55.270
The Sword King laced the wine
with a curse—

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:56.940
of course I must answer.

00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:58.760
However…

00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.920
I also

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.590
added something to the wine.

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:06.510
Have any of you heard

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.820
of the Lunar Reincarnation Pill?

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:10.860
This substance

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.440
has but one effect:

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:14.950
if taken by someone

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:15.790
who has previously

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:17.960
consumed Blood Ghost Pill,

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:20.670
within 4 hours,

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:23.270
poison will assault the heart,
causing excruciating pain

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:27.070
in the dantian and a gruesome death
as their innards rupture and rot.

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:35.700
Tang Lici! You poisoned us!

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:36.590
How could you

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:38.050
poison the heroes of the jianghu?

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:39.510
This is against all codes of honor!

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.970
Exactly!
How can you resort to such methods?

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.110
You must uphold justice for us,

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:47.350
Sword King!

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:56.620
The world is full
of infinite possibilities,

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:57.810
and human nature

00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.490
is ever elusive.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.480
That is why

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:05.200
I act based

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:06.870
on possibility—

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.250
not on conventional morality.

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:10.640
And as for poison…

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:17.240
wasn't it you, Sword King,
who taught me that?

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:19.980
So tell me, Sword King,

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:21.750
what is it you truly want?

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:23.270
Let me guess.

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:29.400
You, with your dull wits,

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.880
relied on the Evil Pill to master
the "Westwind Slashing Wildfire,"

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.180
thus securing your present status.

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:35.140
And I—born with peerless gifts

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:37.800
and the limitless wealth
of Wanqiao Chamber—

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:38.940
inspired your envy.

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.180
You wanted

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.240
to see me utterly disgraced.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.320
To be honest?

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:45.490
I was never afraid.

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.590
You could have been direct from the start.

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:53.610
What does the one

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.930
who gave you this curse bug
truly wish to know?

00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.300
The Zhoudi Tower murder case?

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:10.660
That's right.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.400
The killer in the Zhoudi Tower case—

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.690
the one who murdered Fang Zhou—

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:17.720
was me.

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:18.890
Tang

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:20.350
Li

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:22.300
Ci.

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:28.230
You liar!

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:29.110
You hypocrite!

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:30.150
You killed Fang Zhou,

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:31.510
destroyed Zhoudi Tower—

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:35.040
how can you live with yourself,
so at peace and self-satisfied?

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:06.730
Did that person not warn you?

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:09.430
Recklessly testing others

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:11.680
is like trying to seize
a bare blade barehanded.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:12.510
Succeed,

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:14.320
and you prove your mastery.

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:15.960
Fail,

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.510
and you lose your hand.

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:19.920
Sword King Yu,

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:23.280
you were nothing
but a pawn to be discarded.

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:26.960
You madman!

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:28.430
You utter lunatic!

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:30.790
Stop spewing this nonsense!

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:41.280
Master Puzhu,

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:43.230
in shielding Tang Lici,
you are harboring a criminal!

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:45.880
Tang Lici's involvement in this case
runs too deep.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.810
I will interrogate him privately.

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:48.910
Sword King Yu,

00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:50.670
I'll take my leave now.

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:02.920
Puzhu,

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:04.720
think carefully.

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:06.640
If you stand by his side,

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:09.150
you make an enemy of the entire jianghu!

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:13.700
Tang Lici,

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:15.730
was what you said true?

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:21.890
Is this

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:24.350
the backlash of the Truth Teller?

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:25.820
Could it be…

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.420
"The killer in the Zhoudi Tower case—

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:30.500
the one who murdered Fang Zhou—

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:31.960
was me.

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:33.240
Tang

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:34.750
Li

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:36.580
Ci."

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:49.130
Sword King,

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.450
I've heard the legend—

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:51.710
of the Lunar Reincarnation Pill

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:52.700
that can detect the Blood Ghost Pill.

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:54.220
Was it really in the wine?

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.640
Are we in danger?

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:57.880
Exactly!

00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:59.030
Fools!

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.350
If a pill

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:02.750
like Lunar Reincarnation Pill
truly existed in the jianghu,

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:04.310
would Shao Yanping not know of it?

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:06.040
Would our Master not know of it?

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:07.310
It was nothing

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.160
but Tang Lici's bluff!

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:10.910
But just now, Master Puzhu

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:12.470
already took his side.

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:15.080
Could it be that we've already…

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:16.780
What is there to panic about?

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:19.310
The Evil Pill scandal—

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:21.290
how many years
has the Sword Alliance investigated it,

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:22.950
and what have they uncovered?

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:23.960
What we must do now

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:25.700
is put on a convincing act

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:27.640
and not lose our nerve.

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:29.190
As for the rest,

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:31.330
I have my own plans.

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:35.830
Understood, Sword King.

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:36.640
To think

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:37.880
that Master Puzhu

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:38.640
would intervene

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.270
to protect a suspect
in the Zhoudi Tower case—

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:42.040
someone the entire world wants dead—

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.500
even at the cost
of openly opposing the Yu family.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:45.110
Mr. Tang,

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:47.160
you have spun

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:48.970
far too many lies today.

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:53.010
What exactly did you put in the wine?

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.240
What's happening?
Why is someone collapsing?

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:03.790
"Excruciating pain in the dantian,

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:05.270
potent poison attacking the heart,

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:07.270
innards festering and rupturing…"

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:09.120
It's Tang Lici's doing!

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:27.530
Sword King,

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:28.670
save me!

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:32.200
All of you—shut up!

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.830
Shut up!

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:34.850
Puzhu hasn't gone far.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.040
If any of you give us away,

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:39.480
don't blame me for what comes next.

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:45.750
I've finished recording everything.

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:46.440
Take a look.

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:50.560
Elder Liu

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.370
of Chunyang Palace,

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:54.580
Six Blades of Changfeng Sect,

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.650
and Hero Gou of the Cleft Peak Sect!

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:57.510
All these who pose as upright figures

00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:58.750
in their daily lives,

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:02.340
yet every one of them
has been ensnared by Fengliu Shop.

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:02.970
Let's go.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.570
What I administered

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:08.920
was nothing more than a common laxative.

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:13.970
On one side, they faced
my relentless pressure;

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:16.100
on the other, your public support.

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:17.870
Seeing their long-standing conspiracy

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:19.270
on the verge of exposure—

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:21.790
even if Yu Qifeng could steel himself,

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:22.960
his cowardly followers

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.200
would crumble

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.190
at the slightest touch,

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:27.710
like a collapsing tower.

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:29.110
And did you

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:31.770
not also step in for me, Master Puzhu?

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:33.380
That was my true aim.

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:44.360
Shen,

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.280
it's alright.

00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:49.310
Master Puzhu

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:50.910
is simply letting off steam.

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.640
Now that we have the list,

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:55.790
I've kept my word.

00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:58.000
As an apology,

00:29:58.220 --> 00:29:59.420
may I invite you

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:03.000
to join me for a moonlit cruise
on the Phoenix River?

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:06.520
Let us admire

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.080
the beauty of Sword King City together—

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:11.620
what do you say?

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:19.210
Fire!

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:20.270
Put out the fire!

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.570
Hurry!

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.070
Fire! Hurry!

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.400
Hurry!

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.270
Move faster—over there!

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:26.670
Li San,

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:28.570
how did this start?

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:30.030
I don't know either!

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:31.870
Commander Yu, we can't leave now—

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:34.440
the wind is driving the cursed fire
right toward us!

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.200
Faster!

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:51.380
Sir,

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:52.440
the mast is repaired.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.300
We can set sail.

00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:54.610
Full speed ahead!

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:55.000
Quick!

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:55.680
Full speed!

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:58.210
We've already lost too much time.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.130
Accelerate!

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:03.020
Get through the narrows ahead.

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:03.460
Aye!

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:04.690
Accelerate!

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:26.480
What insolent fool

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:28.720
dares block the Yu family's cargo ship,

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.850
hiding in shadows and playing tricks?

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.550
So it's you, Mr. Tang.

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:51.560
Of all the waterways

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:53.930
you could take, to cross paths tonight—

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:55.660
surely this is no coincidence?

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.440
You seem to be overthinking it,
Commander Yu.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.140
I am merely cruising the gorge by night,

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:02.090
enjoying the moon and strumming a tune
with my friend,

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:03.490
too enchanted to return.

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:06.070
My apologies for the interruption,
Commander Yu.

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:08.160
I see you are occupied
with pressing matters.

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.000
Tang Lici,

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:11.790
enough games.

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:13.440
If you have something to say,

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.300
speak plainly.

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.070
A moonlit cruise

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:20.990
calls for fireworks.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:21.880
What?

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:50.890
Joy shared is joy doubled.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.130
Those present shall have their share.

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:55.060
Gold!

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:55.890
It's gold!

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:57.930
We're rich!

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.890
It's all mine!

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:19.260
Trouble!

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:21.080
Trouble, Commander!

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.410
The cargo on the rear ship
has been looted!

00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:27.110
Tang Lici!

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:30.120
Anyone causing chaos
or fighting over the spoils

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:31.000
will be executed on the spot!

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:31.610
Move!

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:36.240
You thief!

00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:37.270
Drop those goods!

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.350
Stop him!

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:40.050
-Yes!
-Don't let him escape!

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:57.870
Xue Xianzi!

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:02.200
Follow me.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.160
Tang Lici,

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:07.970
you openly collude with scum

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:09.739
to plunder the Yu family's cargo ship.

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:12.070
Do you have no respect
for Sword King City?

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:13.699
Do you have no respect
for the rules of the jianghu?

00:34:13.699 --> 00:34:15.520
You misunderstand, Commander Yu.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.850
That white-haired man—

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:18.710
I don't even know him.

00:34:18.889 --> 00:34:20.040
Tonight,

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:21.870
I am simply admiring the scenery

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.409
and setting off fireworks.

00:34:23.719 --> 00:34:25.150
Your missing cargo

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:26.659
has nothing to do with me.

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:29.320
Isn't that right,

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.480
Master Puzhu?

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:39.590
Master Puzhu?

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:44.630
The only guest I invited tonight

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:45.800
was Master Puzhu.

00:34:45.929 --> 00:34:48.320
When you accuse me of colluding
with scum, Commander Yu,

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.250
are you referring to Master Puzhu?

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:53.389
Master Puzhu,

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:55.350
I did not realize you were here.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.320
My apologies for the offense.

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:57.110
May I ask—

00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:59.640
does the Sword Alliance endorse this?

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:08.500
I understand now.

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:11.480
The nature
of Mr. Tang's actions tonight is,

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:12.550
I am certain,

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.500
not lost on your discernment.

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:16.550
I have faith in your wisdom, Master Puzhu—

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:17.550
that you would

00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:19.880
neither be deceived by scoundrels

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:22.400
nor ally yourself with criminals.

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:25.340
I will take my leave now.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.000
Turn the ship around.

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:27.840
We depart.

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:35.280
So

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:37.130
this was your true aim all along.

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:38.770
We're both in the same boat now—

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:41.300
consider the use
of your esteemed reputation

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.000
as my passage fee.

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:49.320
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.070
Was my tune not pleasing,

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:54.200
or the fireworks not dazzling enough?

00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:59.150
You bully others through influence,

00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:00.860
disregarding due process and evidence.

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:03.120
Your methods are not the path of justice.

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:05.990
Your criticism is warranted, Master Puzhu.

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.590
So,

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:08.110
in the name of the fairness and justice

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:09.070
you uphold,

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:10.280
I should have let them

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:11.630
transport

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.000
the goods unnoticed,

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.130
as they always have.

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:15.120
Is that right?

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:16.840
I should have sent a formal notice
in advance,

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.720
allowing Yu Qifeng to prepare,

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.400
then paid a polite visit,

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:22.070
listened to his excuses,

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:23.800
and left politely—

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:26.350
is that

00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:28.340
how a righteous sect

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:29.570
ought to act?

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:31.830
You were Head Fang's disciple.

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:33.170
What of it?

00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:37.080
Head Fang took the world's troubles
as his own responsibility—

00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:38.350
a gentleman praised

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:39.750
throughout the jianghu.

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:40.990
But...

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:42.630
he is dead.

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:44.550
I am different.

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:46.030
I

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:47.790
only wish to live.

00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:53.600
From now on,

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.710
you and I

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.530
need not walk the same path.

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:08.440
Is this the evidence

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.120
you two were speaking of?

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:14.110
Master Puzhu

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:15.640
disdains sharing our path.

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:16.710
Destroy

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.400
all the Evil Pills.

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:21.250
You're just abandoning all the cargo

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:22.680
I worked all night to find?

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:23.320
Fine.

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:24.040
I'll throw it away.

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:24.690
Wait!

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:40.140
Well,

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:41.230
what do we do now?

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:44.360
We now

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:46.150
have both the list
and the physical evidence.

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:47.510
I will arrest Yu Qifeng

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:48.530
at once.

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:50.670
You are mistaken, Master Puzhu.

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.800
I have won

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.230
our wager.

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:55.670
And the terms

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:56.510
of our wager dictate

00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:58.550
that you cannot
take Yu Qifeng away directly.

00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:59.550
Tang Lici!

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:01.070
Not only can you

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:02.360
not take Yu Qifeng—

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.070
I demand that you not interfere

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:05.070
in any further matters

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:06.670
concerning Sword King City.

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:09.170
The terms of our bet

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:12.150
have never changed.

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:17.380
I cannot agree to that.

00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:22.330
Step aside.

00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:26.730
Time to feed the fish their special treat.

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:28.270
This is the good stuff.

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:43.130
I may refrain from acting,

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:45.740
but the Sword Alliance

00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:47.270
will not stand by.

00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:48.680
You

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:50.720
must not kill Yu Qifeng.

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:52.670
In that case,

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:54.400
Master Puzhu,

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.150
your time is limited.

00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:56.230
Twelve hours—

00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:57.280
that's the shortest round trip

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.610
between the Sword Alliance
and Sword King City.

00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:01.140
If it truly comes to a fight,

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:02.760
I cannot promise

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.430
I won't take his life.

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:18.160
What about the rest of these?

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:24.150
Destroy them all.

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:30.610
A bunch of useless fools!

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:33.650
I deployed the Yu family's finest elites,

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:36.030
and they couldn't even stop Xue Xianzi!

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:37.250
Trash!

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.320
Tang Lici!

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:50.570
Puzhu!

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:52.960
You and the Sword Alliance

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.960
will pay for this!

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:19.230
You've bungled everything,

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:21.510
and you still cling to your delusions?

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:24.150
Courage you may have,

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:26.110
but wisdom eludes you.

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:27.650
To what do we owe the honor

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:29.740
of your presence, Master?

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:37.030
You old fool.

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.320
What a shame to see you

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:41.290
still in one piece.

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:43.550
Know your place!

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:45.960
The Master is speaking.

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:51.400
Let me count

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:52.400
the foolish moves you made today

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:53.880
on your own authority.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:55.770
First,

00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:57.850
you lacked ruthlessness—

00:40:58.020 --> 00:40:59.650
your attempt to poison Tang Lici failed

00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:01.470
and instead exposed the other pill users.

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:02.430
Second,

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:04.050
you thought you were clever—

00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:05.960
afraid Puzhu

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:07.220
would see through you,

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:09.440
you panicked and tried
to smuggle the pills out of the city,

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:11.040
only to fall into their trap.

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:12.580
Third,

00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:14.640
you overestimated yourself.

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:16.280
Did you truly believe

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.110
you still had a chance
to crawl away and cling

00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:19.370
to your wretched life?

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.370
After all this,

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:25.000
it's time you faced reality.

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:31.660
Even if you wish to kill me, Master,

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:34.010
now is not the time to do it.

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:36.760
And why is that?

00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:39.440
Surely you must want to know

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:42.150
what Tang Lici said

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:44.100
after drinking the Truth Teller?

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:45.720
Why guess?

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:47.850
He admitted he killed Fang Zhou,

00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:48.560
didn't he?

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:51.050
If you already knew the answer,

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:54.760
why go to such lengths?

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:55.960
The grudge between him and me

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:57.560
is beyond your understanding.

00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:58.360
As for today's affairs,

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.360
I have a different strategy in mind.

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:02.860
What do you mean by that, Master?

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:14.800
Master,

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:18.430
why have you come?

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:20.320
If I hadn't,

00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:23.110
how would I have known
you were so incompetent?

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:24.490
I have failed.

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:26.900
I await your punishment.

00:42:28.450 --> 00:42:29.530
Don't be afraid.

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:30.550
I came

00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:31.630
because there is another matter—

00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:33.940
one vital to the foundation
of Sword King City—

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:35.340
that I need you to handle.

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:37.560
Please tell me, Master.

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:51.470
Once it is done,

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:53.550
Sword King City

00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:55.470
will preserve its honor
for a century to come.

00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:57.330
And I will publicly recognize you

00:42:57.590 --> 00:42:58.880
as my son.

00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:01.450
Do not disappoint me.

00:43:05.830 --> 00:43:06.590
Understood.

00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:07.330
Good.

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:25.290
You even used Furen?

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:27.230
If you have any grievance,

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:28.090
direct it at me!

00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:29.880
You will not disrespect the Master!

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:31.210
It's of no consequence.

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:36.850
The Yu family's defeat

00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:39.400
does not mean my own.

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:42.030
I enjoy opposing Tang Lici,

00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:44.280
but I take even greater pleasure
in saving lives.

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.080
Rest assured—

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:46.510
your life is

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:48.960
under my protection tonight.

00:43:49.070 --> 00:43:50.510
I admire your ambition.

00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:52.060
That is why tomorrow,

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:53.570
you will kill for me.

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:56.320
Master,

00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:59.130
who do you wish me to eliminate?

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:02.400
Everyone.
