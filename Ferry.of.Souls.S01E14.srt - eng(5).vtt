00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.170
Bootlicker.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.370
You try it first.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.610
Bootlicker.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.000
It's good.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.730
Just a bit salty.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.960
Granny.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.290
You try some too.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.040
I'm getting old.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.920
My teeth aren't good anymore.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.250
I'll go get my dentures.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.880
I'll be right back.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.280
Is it really that bad?

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.210
Let's forget it.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.360
I'll make noodles for everyone.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.490
Noodles are easier to digest at night.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.840
Noodles.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.760
Noodles.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.530
Just add some water to the rice.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.010
This hairpin

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.480
really suits you.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.160
Everything looks good on me.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.760
Did you know from the beginning

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.530
that I was impersonating Zou Haitang?

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.960
No matter how you change your appearance,

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.690
I can recognize you at a glance.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.760
What are you thinking about?

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.290
Do you think Tao Shi,

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.089
Mei Jiulang,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.459
Zou Haitang and the others

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.959
used to hate me back then?

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.820
Haven't we already

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.120
helped them resolve their obsessions?

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.090
For thousands of years,

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:35.960
I always thought

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.090
that between myself and demons

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:40.280
was a conflict between good and evil.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.920
But

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.400
since you came to the inn,

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.080
when you showed me clearly

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.400
their past,

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.800
I finally understood

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.159
what was behind

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.580
all those obsessions.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.840
I wonder

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.240
if I had understood

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.940
their hardships a thousand years ago

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.260
and resolved their obsessions then,

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.040
would they

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.200
have had to suffer in this life?

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.360
Some things

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.600
take time to understand.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.290
You've paid a price for that too, haven't you?

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.880
Dongfang,

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.960
what if someday,

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.700
I mean, just hypothetically,

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:43.960
if I were to vanish into thin air,

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.240
would you look for me?

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.360
Of course I would.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.159
I might not recognize you in disguise,

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:56.159
but I'd definitely know your ashes.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.120
What's wrong with you?

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.020
Don't think about sneaking food behind my back.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.040
Don't worry.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.780
Just stay here peacefully

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:14.940
and continue being

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.920
the innkeeper.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.860
Innkeeper.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.820
What's the matter?

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.290
I don't have much time left.

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:48.360
Please let me go back.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.890
Back to the past?

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.720
Forget about saving that demon sword.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.600
You might not even make it back yourself.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.060
Don't even think about it.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:06.600
No.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.760
Don't leave me.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.300
Even if I don't live to become the innkeeper myself,

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.280
I will still save you.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.480
You're not the owner of this inn.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.840
You forced your way here.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.460
You won't be able to go where you want.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.420
You might even lose your life.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.440
Why be so persistent?

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.160
Who are you?

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.460
You don't need to know who I am.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.410
You only need to know

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.940
that I'm someone who can make your wishes come true.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:23.520
Really?

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.650
As long as...

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.480
Boss,

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:50.960
good morning.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.420
Why are you still here?

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.610
I specially prepared this for you.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.100
Changed your mind?

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.760
I know you're just looking out for me.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.360
I won't be stubborn anymore.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.080
Good that you understand.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.410
Don't be foolish again.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:11.480
Go now.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:54.840
Zhu Niaoniao,

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.340
get me a glass of water.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.200
Coming.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.340
Why so obedient today?

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.600
Hey, it's full!

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.200
It's full.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.520
What's wrong?

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.420
You look like you've seen a ghost.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:24.250
Bootlicker.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.800
I think I've messed up.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.240
Really messed up.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:35.800
You bitch!

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.420
You harbinger of doom!

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.380
I'll teach you a lesson today!

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.980
Everyone, come quick!

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.280
Come and see!

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.920
It's this wretched woman

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.600
who killed my son on his wedding night!

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:51.400
Dongfang!

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.440
Dongfang!

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.320
Dongfang!

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:54.680
Dongfang!

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.820
Stop shouting.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.210
I heard everything.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.280
Dongfang!

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.360
Is the innkeeper going to be alright?

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.840
Yang is my husband.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.080
How could I poison him?

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.210
How dare you deny it!

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.040
I'll teach you a lesson!

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.440
What are you trying to do?

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.180
You claim she killed your son.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.400
Where's your evidence?

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.760
You make accusations with no proof

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.020
just to frame someone.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.280
My son was fine before entering the bridal chamber.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.610
How did he suddenly die?

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.160
There was only this wretched woman in the room.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.600
Who else could it be?

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.160
So you have no evidence.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.160
It's nothing but your imagination.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.210
Who do you think you are?

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.250
What business do you have here?

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.130
Are you okay?

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.570
Why are you here?

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.520
The little pig spirit already told me everything.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.050
Now is not the time to discuss this.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.250
I am Zhu Niaoniao's sister.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.560
What does this have to do with me?

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.020
You're talking nonsense.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.200
Her sister Yunniang died long ago.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.060
Her body has already decomposed.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.320
Yunniang?

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.760
You really are a fraud.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.480
Even her sister Yunniang doesn't know.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.240
You're all in this together!

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.280
Oh my goodness!

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.280
My poor son,

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.600
so young and already a scholar,

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.440
yet he died at

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.080
Take them all away!

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.040
the hands of this wicked woman!

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.040
Heaven help me!

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.040
Take them all!

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.380
What are you doing?

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.560
What are you doing?

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.240
Let go of me!

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.040
What's going on here?

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.520
Back to the inn.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:46.880
Hey!

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:49.360
Are we just leaving her?

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.240
Why should we care about her?

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.320
The little pig spirit told me everything.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.960
I think she has a deep obsession.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.160
Why don't we help her?

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.920
Right now we need to quickly investigate

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.920
the truth behind Scholar Yang's death.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:03.980
And that Yunniang,

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.440
I wonder if she's connected to all this.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.400
Yunniang?

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.680
Are you talking about

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.240
Auntie Zhu's daughter?

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.260
My daughter died long ago.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.010
Why are you looking for her?

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.320
What about Zhu Niaoniao?

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.160
Don't mention that ungrateful creature to me.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.420
My daughter kindly took her in years ago,

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.120
treated her like a real sister,

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.180
but what happened?

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.040
On my daughter's wedding night,

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.040
she disappeared.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.560
She insisted on marrying my daughter's husband,

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.280
her brother-in-law Yang Zhiyuan.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.280
Does she have any conscience at all?

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.480
Could it be that Scholar Yang and Yunniang

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.480
were once lovers?

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.280
Hurry up, innkeeper!

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.100
How is it going?

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:51.040
This wound looks like it was made by a butcher's knife.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.520
Could it really be Zhu Niaoniao?

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:07.940
Useless thing.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.160
Who are you calling useless?
