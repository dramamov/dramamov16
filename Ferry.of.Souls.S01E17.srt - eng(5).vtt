00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.130
Mr. Dongfang left early this morning.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.160
He left?

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.120
Why didn't he tell me?

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.020
What are you thinking?

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.560
It couldn't be...

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.120
You've known all along that 1,000 years ago

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.680
Shangguan Feiye was the one who killed you.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.009
Why are you still getting close to her now?

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.880
Because someone like you

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.579
doesn't understand what love is.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.440
I don't understand love?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.240
I'm doing this to protect you.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.480
I didn't want her to hurt you again,

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.940
so I went to great lengths.

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.800
Everything I did was for you.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.820
I won't let you hurt her again.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.920
You want to kill me?

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.720
Even if I have to die with you,

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.520
I still won't let you hurt her again.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.720
You're willing to give up your life for her.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.100
If that's the case,

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.680
then die in her place.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.120
Dongfang.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.400
Are you okay?

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.200
Get up.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.250
Take it easy.

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.200
Shangguan Feiye.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:19.880
You finally came.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.280
Dugu Qiongqi.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.720
It really is you.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.520
What did you do to Dongfang?

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.380
What could I do?

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.280
Just old friends catching up.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.880
Reminiscing about the past.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.000
You dare touch my people?

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.930
You must be tired of living.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.520
Boss.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.320
What's wrong?

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.850
Are you feeling unwell?

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.770
Take it slow, let me help you up.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.410
Did you see that?

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.040
Why is he here?

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.880
So young,

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:05.720
what is he doing?

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.280
This is too dangerous.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.440
Record this.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.130
What could be so bad to make him do this?

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.920
Li Wubai.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.800
What happened here?

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.760
Get him!

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.370
Manager.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.640
The person who jumped is my friend.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.500
Please help me.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.940
Dongfang Zhaobai.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.760
What are you doing here?

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.800
Are you here for revenge?

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.120
Li Wubai.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.920
I haven't even settled scores with you yet.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.200
You're being so desperate to die,

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.800
even jumping off a building.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.560
Dongfang.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.800
I'm so sorry.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.440
Don't mention that to me.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.560
Dongfang.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.800
It's all my fault.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.240
I've let you down.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.970
Are you in some kind of trouble?

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.050
Tell me about it.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.130
Maybe I can help.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.040
How could you help me?

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.880
None of you can help me.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.240
What terrible sin have I committed?

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:04.520
Innkeeper,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.080
Li Wubai is...

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.500
Which one should I wear tomorrow?

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.680
This one's not bad.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.450
Isn't this one nice too?

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.040
Oh my!

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.920
Innkeeper,

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.010
now is not the time to discuss this.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.320
You brought him here, you deal with him.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.840
But he's someone I know after all.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.680
Even though he's delirious

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.240
and we can't get any answers from him.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.040
But we

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.490
can't just abandon him.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.800
He bullied you so much before

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.460
and you still want to help him?

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.100
Innkeeper.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.720
Does Li Wubai

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:39.960
have some kind of obsession too?

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.240
It's not that simple.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.690
It's not just Li Wubai's obsession alone.

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:48.490
Then let's hurry and go.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.240
What's the rush?

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.400
Let me give him a proper welcome first.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.040
Are you looking for light?

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.200
Ghost!

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.400
How could there be ghosts in a monster inn?

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.760
They're all monsters here.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.330
Brother!

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.520
I was wrong!

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.570
Please spare me!

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.600
Dongfang!

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.400
Dongfang!

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.920
Come save me!

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.460
It was all my fault before.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.600
What did you do wrong?

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.000
I'm innocent!

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:27.520
Although I

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.920
stole Dongfang's lover,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.960
but that Liu Yiyi

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.600
she drove me into a corner!

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.400
So?

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.560
And?

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:36.760
How did she trick you?

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.170
That Liu Yiyi

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.520
she's not even human!

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:41.690
At first, she

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.120
acted like an innocent rabbit

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.580
and did everything I said.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.409
She even said

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.240
she'd help me make money in stocks.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:47.640
But

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.800
she ran off with all my money.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.640
She's practically driven me to death now.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.200
I...

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.159
I don't believe a word of it.

00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:55.560
Your life is mine!

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.120
Stay back! Stay back!

00:07:57.159 --> 00:07:58.720
Dongfang!

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.160
Help me!

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:05.800
Li Wubai

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.360
You're finally here.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:11.690
Dongfang

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:16.800
Here

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.160
There are monsters here.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:18.490
Hurry

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.680
Take me away quickly.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.280
Sit down.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.680
This is a monster inn.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.320
It's not a place where people get killed.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.080
I don't care.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.160
Just take me away.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.730
Are you done making a scene?

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.080
Li Wubai.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.059
If you trust me,

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:35.520
our Monster Inn

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.130
can help you.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.919
Can you help me get my money back?

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.600
That depends on how cooperative you are.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.400
I'll cooperate.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.000
I'll definitely cooperate.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.120
I've already witnessed

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.520
how powerful your inn is.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:56.640
Whatever you say,

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.900
I'll definitely do it.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.440
For the money we recover,

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.920
I want

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.120
half of it.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.440
What's with that reaction?

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.040
Forget it if you don't agree.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:08.970
I'll give it.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.330
I'll give it.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.100
We can't guarantee we'll recover the money.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.300
But if we can resolve your obsession,

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:18.320
perhaps

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.940
everything will fall into place.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.200
Obsession.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.520
Boss.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.120
You've become quite

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.730
skilled at this job now.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.320
I just wonder if this

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.450
mission will be difficult.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.520
Boss,

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.060
how's the karmic fire on your body? Is it subsiding?

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.120
It's strange.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.000
Recently, the karmic fire

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.880
has been fading much faster.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.370
It might be completely gone

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.300
by the end of this mission.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.040
That's good.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.560
For thousands of years,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.240
humans and demons were separated by a barrier,

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.000
never crossing into each other's realm.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.800
Until the Demon King devoured the power of ten thousand demons.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.480
He emerged with overwhelming power

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.440
and broke this balance.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.960
Demons rampaged through the human world,

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.320
bringing humanity to the brink of extinction.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:14.960
Fortunately,

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.920
demon hunters cared for all living beings

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.440
and fought to eliminate the demons.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.080
But the Demon King was too powerful.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.600
Despite their best efforts,

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.660
the demon hunters couldn't prevail.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:30.720
In the end,

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.320
the war ended with humanity's devastating defeat,

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.520
forcing them to offer tributes to demons for peace.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.080
Today

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.600
is once again the day to deliver the tribute.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.800
This year's offering

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:47.800
is the rare treasure 'Fire Tree Silver Flower' that appears once in a thousand years.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:48.560
Legend has it

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.570
it can absorb human obsessions

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.130
to nourish demonic powers.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.040
If the Demon King obtains it,

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.240
great disaster will spread

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.120
with nothing to stop it.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.210
The Fire Tree Silver Flower is priceless.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.440
So many people have their eyes on it.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.460
I'm afraid the escort journey

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:07.860
won't be peaceful.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.840
Liu Yiyi,

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:10.640
Li Wubai,

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:11.440
Wu Hu,

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.180
Chen Jiang,

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.600
who are escorting the gift this time, are the four greatest masters of our time.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.200
Brother, you worry too much.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.300
I never thought

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.640
that Li Wubai and Liu Yiyi from a thousand years ago

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.700
were actually martial arts masters.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:25.880
Boss,

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.440
why are you stepping on me?

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.500
Dongfang Zhaobai,

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.040
you volunteered to come with me this time.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.400
It's not because of Liu Yiyi, is it?

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.200
Of course not.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.530
It's because...

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.000
Because what?

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:39.880
You're the boss!

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.480
If something happened to you,

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.480
I'd be out of a job.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:48.640
Hey, where are you going?

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:49.570
Don't follow me.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:54.800
Come take a look!

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.280
Come see!

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.760
The most beautiful clothes with the latest styles.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.480
Come see, don't miss out!

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:16.960
What?

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:18.480
Boss,

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.690
today is the Qixi Festival.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.720
Let's go to the lantern festival together.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.520
I'm not going.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:32.960
Are you still mad at me?

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:33.620
No, I'm not.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.800
How did you know I was thirsty?

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:42.400
Thank you.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:48.200
Guess

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:48.920
what this is.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:49.720
I won't guess.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.840
Oh come on, just take a guess.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:52.640
What is it?

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.360
A bug, a mouse, or a snake?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.600
Is that really how you see me?

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:15.480
Do you like it?

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.280
It's alright.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.620
Not angry anymore?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.360
Considering you've been quite thoughtful,

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.290
I'll let you off the hook this time.

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.920
So you've accepted all the gifts,

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.180
and your anger is gone.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.280
Let's go to the lantern festival together.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:41.560
What lantern festival?

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:42.880
Today is the Qixi lantern festival.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:43.880
It's very lively.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.560
I've lived for a thousand years.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:46.600
I've seen everything.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.130
Why should I join the crowd?

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:49.800
Boss.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.780
I've been working for you for so long.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.200
Come with me to the lantern festival.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.680
Consider it an employee benefit.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:57.080
What do you say?
