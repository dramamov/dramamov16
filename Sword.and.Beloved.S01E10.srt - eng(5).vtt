[Sword and Beloved]

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.550
[Episode 10]

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.860
"Little Deer"?

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.240
You mean Lu Shu, the deer demon?

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:59.789
Did he...

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.890
come from Xishu a year ago?

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.760
Yes.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.720
He's been lying.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.680
The forests in Xishu have withered,

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.540
so all the deer demons
have already left that place.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.890
I'll send someone to
trace his whereabouts.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.690
Soldier, I want to ask you something.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.920
If we can find
the true culprit behind this,

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.520
could you spare Qi

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.410
and everyone in Peach Village,
humans and demons alike?

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.480
Qi hasn't done anything wrong.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.910
I don't have to be with him.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.120
He is...

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.750
the gentlest, kindest man
I've ever met in this world.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.000
It's time.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.960
Qingli,

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.190
you need to prepare for the ceremony.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.360
No matter the outcome,

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.240
everyone has been looking forward to it
for so long.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.280
Don't let them miss

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.610
the night peach blossoms blooming today.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.590
Okay.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.540
Come on.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.960
Here.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:16.310
Thank you.

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:17.410
Here.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.140
Take it.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.000
Thank you.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.390
Here's to you.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.000
Here.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.360
Here.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:26.470
Thank you.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.960
Here.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.630
Take it.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:29.230
Thank you.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.470
Yours.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.680
You're welcome.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.530
Here you go.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.870
Here.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.270
I have one too.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.360
Take it.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.470
You are...

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.030
Lu Shu?

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.630
Yes.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.840
Here, have some more.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.960
Have some more.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.560
Thank you.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:49.400
Here you go.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.079
Yours.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.030
Thank you.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.590
For you.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.960
Here.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.750
Young Master Fugui,

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:57.550
I found Lu Shu.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.620
He's right among them.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:05.870
Qingli is here!

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:06.870
The fairy is here.

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:52.600
The night peach blossoms bloom.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.950
The prayer begins.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.820
The full moon hangs in the sky.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.160
We pray for humans and demons to coexist

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.120
and for there to be no more divisions
of race or class in this world.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.560
We pray for humans and demons to coexist

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.270
and for there to be no more divisions
of race or class in this world.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.830
Colorful butterflies dance.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.950
We pray for peaceful years

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.070
and for there to be
no more killing in the world.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.270
We pray for peaceful years

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.800
and for there to be
no more killing in the world.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.660
May humans and demons coexist...

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.070
and no more killing.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.270
So beautiful.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.160
So beautiful.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.290
Our wishes will surely come true.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.790
The Night Peach Tree blooms.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.750
I pray that all people and demons

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:09.810
may have their wishes fulfilled.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.200
They say that Qingli is a butterfly demon.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.190
Whenever her demon power is at its peak

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:19.390
during the full moon,

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.820
she can summon swarms of butterflies...

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.890
and make this Night Peach Tree bloom.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:27.040
These are just

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.970
peach blossoms conjured by magic.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.360
It's just that they want to believe

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.800
the flowers have truly bloomed.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.750
They're all people
who've experienced despair,

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:39.950
who couldn't believe

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.030
there could be a paradise

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.430
in this world

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:46.409
where we could make a home.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.770
But, Young Master Fugui...

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.159
Look.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.270
In this Peach Village,

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.670
humans and demons alike,

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:57.750
strong or weak,

00:07:59.159 --> 00:08:00.950
can live well,

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.430
do what they like,

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:05.560
and live...

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.460
the life they want to live.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:15.010
Unfortunately...

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:17.830
What?

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:22.830
Nothing.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.170
Young Master Fugui,

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.200
look over there!

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:30.630
That one is Lu Shu.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.740
Rest here for a moment.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:37.840
Okay.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.360
You are Lu Shu?

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:56.530
You gave the villagers

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.090
the seeds for this flower, didn't you?

00:08:59.270 --> 00:08:59.870
Tell me!

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.700
What's your relationship with Chakuwa?

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.200
Lu Shu.

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:19.080
Who are you really?

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.510
What exactly is

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:23.370
that coreless red flower?

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:35.030
A teleportation talisman.

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:37.440
Since you were already prepared
to run away,

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.300
why did you still want to fight me?

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.000
Tell me.

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.670
Oh no,

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:46.670
it's a diversion tactic.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:06.130
Why hasn't Young Master Fugui
come back yet?

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:09.720
Little spider.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:12.360
My stomach hurts so much.

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:15.000
I feel like something's churning inside.

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:17.150
You probably just ate too much.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:18.870
You glutton.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.750
Jiu.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:29.270
Jiu?

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:30.790
Jiu...

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:48.700
What happened?

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:51.240
Wake up.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:52.000
Wake up!

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:54.390
Man.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:55.240
Man!

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:55.870
Wake up!

00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.760
Granny Shui.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.050
Granny Shui?

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:02.120
Granny Shui?

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:04.550
Qi.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.440
Qi.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.510
Qingli?

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:27.390
Qingli?

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.950
Why are you...

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.890
Why did they...

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:36.190
Why did they all pass out?

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.750
They're all tired.

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:51.080
You're tired too.

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:54.770
You should take a rest.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:03.680
Don't be afraid.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:06.670
Soon,

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.150
you'll truly belong to me.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.350
After preparing for so long,

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.060
it's finally the season
to harvest Chakuwa.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:22.560
Qingtong.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:25.560
Qingtong?

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:03.030
Zhang Qi.

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:05.550
Zhang Qi?

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:21.910
Qingli.

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:23.510
Come out.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.270
You're the one who made the Chakuwa,

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:27.440
aren't you?

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:30.960
Come out!

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.080
Mr. Zhang took Chakuwa

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.390
and inhaled the phosphorus powder.

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:49.650
He's under my control.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.270
Now,

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:53.670
he's completely mine.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:57.870
Ah.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.750
Soldier, you really are dull.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.480
At a time like this,

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:05.250
shouldn't you be asking me

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.030
why I've done all this?

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:14.120
I've orchestrated such a perfect scheme.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.090
If I can't tell anyone about it,

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:20.480
what's the point of all this?

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:22.750
How about

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.480
I take you to a better place

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.000
and tell you slowly?

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:43.750
Young Master...

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:45.870
Young Master Fugui...

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:56.400
[Qingli's Frozen Barrier]

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:00.750
This is...

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.390
a barrier?

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.080
Within this barrier,

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.120
the Night Peach Tree
grants us even greater power.

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:09.790
The Zhang Qi you're facing now

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.270
is not the Zhang Qi you once knew.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.270
Mr. Zhang, wake up now!

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:00.960
You asked for this!

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.240
Wake up!

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:36.110
Fairy Qingli...

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:38.590
Why are you doing this?

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:40.960
"Fairy Qingli"?

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.220
Am I a butterfly fairy?

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.550
Do you know

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.830
what my true form is?

[Qingli, Ghost-faced Moth Demon]

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:23.920
I'm no butterfly.

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:26.830
I'm a ghost-faced moth.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.480
In Dongshan Insect Valley,

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.070
a lowly ghost-faced moth demon

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:34.880
has to endure endless filth

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.270
and bullying...

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.270
just to survive.

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:43.680
Luckily,

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:46.110
I encountered something

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:48.480
that could change my fate—

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:52.310
the seeds of Chakuwa.

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:55.000
What exactly is Chakuwa?

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.840
They're the eggs
of the ancient bird demon.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.300
These eggs can parasitize
plants and trees—

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:02.830
perfect seeds.

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:05.270
When Lu Shu

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:06.030
distributed these seeds

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:08.110
to those villagers,

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.750
they were all so delighted.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.270
These are the seeds I prepared.

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:15.440
You can plant them.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.810
They'll grow into beautiful flowers.

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:23.650
Those seeds aren't flower seeds—

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.280
they're parasitic insects.

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.000
Once they enter the human body,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.030
they rapidly absorb life force

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.680
and become Chakuwa.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.240
So you used Mr. Zhang's kindness

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.880
to trick everyone here...

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:42.720
all to make your wretched medicine!

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.350
What a perfect plan!

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:47.770
If it weren't for today's little accident,

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:51.110
when Peach Village disappeared tonight,

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:53.000
who would've cared about their lives?

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.660
And who would've remembered
they ever existed?

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:01.920
But after doing this...

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.480
how can you face
Mr. Zhang's sincere feelings?

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:21.790
There's actually such a fool in this world

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:26.030
who spent seven whole years

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:30.650
purging the poisonous miasma
of this desolate land...

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:36.920
All to give
a lowly ghost-faced moth demon...

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:40.160
a home.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.510
He's the only person

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:45.710
in this world who's ever been kind to me.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:48.510
But you know what?

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:52.200
I despise all things holy and flawless.

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.160
The moment you appeared,

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:57.350
my heart raced uncontrollably.

00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.920
I knew then

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:01.480
that I'd found my life's purpose.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.780
So even if it takes the rest of my life,

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.260
I'll drag you down from your pedestal

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:08.840

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.160
The Zhang Qi now

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:16.120
is the most perfect version of him
in my heart.

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:21.680
So I want him

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:24.510
