00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.200
He's dead.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.009
Mei Jiulang is dead.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.440
You died so easily.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.760
Mei Jiulang.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.440
All these years.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.120
You've made things difficult for me at every turn.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.040
If I did anything slightly against your wishes,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.570
you'd threaten to throw me out of the theater.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.020
You knew my talent was better than yours,

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.320
so you were jealous of me.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.520
You were afraid I'd have my day,

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.840
afraid that one day I would surpass you.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.100
Tell me.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.640
Why did you torture me like that?

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.400
Speak!

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.600
Why?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.760
Tell me why!

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.120
Now it's perfect.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.640
You're dead here,

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.560
and no one will ever know.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.840
From now on,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.280
I am Mei Jiulang.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.890
I am the most famous actor in the world.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.880
Su Huasheng.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.440
It's me.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.200
You all...

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.930
It was you after all.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.370
You killed Mei Jiulang.

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.079
He clearly brought this on himself.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.120
Dare you deny you locked him up here?

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.720
No.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.329
I only meant to knock him unconscious,

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.240
so I could take his place on stage

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.970
and fulfill my lifelong dream.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.000
It's you!

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.690
It's all your fault.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.050
You ruined everything.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.880
I had no choice but to knock him out

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.610
and lock him in this ice cellar.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.339
But who knew he was so weak?

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:21.610
In just this short time,

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.760
he actually died here.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.120
Heaven truly has eyes!

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.120
You killed him.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.180
He deserved to die.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.600
Twelve years.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.080
Twelve years.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.060
I've been at Ruichun Garden for a full twelve years.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:46.770
I respected him.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.360
I loved him.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.180
But what about him?

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.380
He insisted on tormenting me.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.920
He treated me like an animal.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.490
But I'm not inferior to him.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.160
I'm not inferior to Mei Jiulang.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.480
Huasheng.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.600
You're slacking off again.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.040
Take out my headdress and clean it thoroughly.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.500
In broad daylight!

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.500
Practicing your voice and wailing like a ghost.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.440
If I catch you practicing in secret again,

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.800
I'll have someone send you away immediately.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.240
But...

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.720
But I...

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.320
Go now!

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.600
After that,

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.680
whenever he went to perform at the Imperial Uncle's mansion,

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.480
he would lock me in the woodshed.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.080
Only when he returned,

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.360
would he let me out.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.640
So,

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.560
he was afraid you'd become a lead performer

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.560
and outshine him.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.480
Exactly.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.320
A few days ago,

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.200
I was secretly practicing alone in the garden.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.560
I happened to run into the Imperial Uncle who was visiting.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.360
He praised me.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.480
He said

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.000
my singing was as good as Mei Jiulang's.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.260
Who would have thought

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.970
that one compliment

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.840
would earn me a severe beating.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.160
I'll beat you to death, you foolish creature!

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.280
How dare you seduce the Imperial Uncle!

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.400
Let me tell you,

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.520
as long as I, Mei Jiulang, am alive,

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.840
you'll never set foot on stage.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.100
I'll beat you to death!

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.320
Beat you to death!

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.480
Kill you!

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:40.720
Senior.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.400
Senior, please stop beating me.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.680
I won't dare do it again.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.880
You dare speak of a next time?

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.760
I'll kill you!

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.040
Kill you!

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:48.840
Beat you to death!

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.800
So you killed him.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.040
I didn't.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.800
I just wanted him to taste

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.480
what I had been through.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.600
Who knew

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.920
he would die like that.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.930
Su Huasheng.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.880
You think with your little speech

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.360
you can clear yourself of charges?

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.420
What are you doing?

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.200
Going to the authorities.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.560
The law will punish you.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:20.880
You all...

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:22.440
Master.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.090
You're just in time.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.930
We found Mei Jiulang's body

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.400
in the ice cellar.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.840
Body?

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.610
Mei Jiulang is dead?

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.980
He's the murderer,

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:33.970
Su Huasheng.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.080
Do you have any evidence?

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.680
So you don't.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.159
Lock it up.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:43.930
Come with me.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.330
You can't leave.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.120
This is murder. You can't just walk away.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:49.840
Oh my,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.460
this isn't such a big deal.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.130
The Minister wants Mei Jiulang to perform

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.850
for a reward of 1,000 taels.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.130
We can't delay this!

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:57.840
Wait.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.440
You already knew that wasn't Mei Jiulang on stage,

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.220
didn't you?

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.720
Ridiculous!

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.090
I made Mei Jiulang's career with my own hands.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.600
Do you think I wouldn't know

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.560
if that was him on stage or not?

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.720
Then why didn't you look for him?

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.920
Why should I look for anyone?

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.960
Now there's someone ready

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.040
who sings even better than him right here.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.800
Why should I go through all that trouble?

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.120
Now that he's dead,

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.330
it's actually convenient.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.140
Makes room for new talent.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.700
You're disregarding human life!

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:41.600
You two cooks,

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.640
are you tired of living?

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.940
Since you care so much about Mei Jiulang,

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.400
perhaps you should

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.800
go join him.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.720
Know your place!

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.800
Lock this ice cellar.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.360
Without my permission,

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.890
no one is allowed to open it.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.640
Don't waste your energy.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.520
Everyone in Ruichun Garden obeys the boss.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.320
Even if they hear your calls,

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.890
they won't come to help.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.060
We can't just sit here waiting to die.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.800
If we stay here for two hours,

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.060
we'll freeze to death.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:49.340
Innkeeper,

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:50.920
give me the flint.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.640
No offense intended.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:33.720
Amitabha.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.970
Are you feeling better?

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.340
I am the innkeeper of the Monster Inn.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.650
This mere ice cellar

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.740
doesn't feel cold to me at all.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.160
Once we get out of here,

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.560
you can be the impressive innkeeper again.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.400
Dongfang.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:49.680
I'm sorry.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.040
What did you say?

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.320
Perhaps I was too selfish.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.180
I shouldn't have brought you to this inn.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:06.880
Innkeeper.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.690
There's nothing to be sorry about.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.370
On the contrary.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.340
I should thank you.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.000
Thank you for letting me stay at the inn.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.300
Innkeeper.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.160
Innkeeper.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.280
Feiye.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.240
Feiye.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:31.600
Feiye.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:32.890
Don't sleep.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:34.440
Feiye.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.720
Is anybody there?

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:41.920
Help!

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.240
Hurry to the Imperial Uncle's mansion.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.160
Don't be late.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:04.600
Feiye.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:06.480
So hot.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:07.480
Feiye.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.240
So hot.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.080
Innkeeper.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.980
You're hallucinating that you feel hot.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.450
Hold on a little longer.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.970
Mei Jiulang has transformed into a demon.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.120
Let him go.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.380
The person who killed you is Su Huasheng.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:04.770
The door is open.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:06.240
Go now!

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.200
Okay.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:29.560
Your Excellency.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:30.900
The song has ended.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.280
I shall take my leave now.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.680
Jiulang.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.440
Jiulang.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.080
Why such a hurry?

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.800
Where are you going?

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:45.680
It's time

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.570
to return to the garden.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.600
Jiulang.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.640
We're old friends, aren't we?

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.920
How come you haven't visited for days

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.480
and forgotten our customs here?

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.580
Please show some respect.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.400
You may leave if you wish,

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.360
but I have one request.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.040
A few days ago,

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:12.560
I went to

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.600
Ruichun Garden and saw an apprentice.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.320
I heard his name is Su Huasheng.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.720
He's handsome and refined,

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.160
and seems quite obedient.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.920
Why don't you hand him over to me?

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.560
Then I might let you go.

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:44.420
This is bad.

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.480
The Imperial Uncle is in danger.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.330
Then let's hurry and stop them.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.130
Who's there?

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.720
The Imperial Uncle is in danger!

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.380
Move aside!

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:54.400
Tonight, the Imperial Uncle

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.640
is only receiving Mei Jiulang.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:56.640
No one else is allowed inside.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:57.640
Your Excellency!

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Your Excellency!

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.160
Who are

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:15.640
you?

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.120
Help!

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.000
Someone's trying to break into the Imperial Uncle's residence!

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:23.800
Seize them!
