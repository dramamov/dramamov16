00:00:19.582 --> 00:00:22.752
Wow! Such a lovely place!

00:00:23.378 --> 00:00:26.214
Why are you tagging along?

00:00:26.297 --> 00:00:27.757
I'm paying for the trip.

00:00:28.383 --> 00:00:31.177
Be grateful that I've even let you
carry my luggage.

00:00:32.762 --> 00:00:35.974
Hey, did you just click your tongue?
You did, didn't you?

00:00:36.057 --> 00:00:37.142
Nope, I didn't.

00:00:37.225 --> 00:00:38.101
You did.

00:00:38.184 --> 00:00:41.271
SOKEI CUP ROOKIE LEAGUE 2025

00:00:42.772 --> 00:00:43.731
Let's go.

00:00:44.232 --> 00:00:45.817
Hey, wait.

00:00:48.528 --> 00:00:50.947
Everyone looks so young.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.117
The Rookie League
is a gateway for young talents,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.121
only open for new kishi,
joryu kishi, and amateur representatives.

00:00:58.746 --> 00:01:01.457
But age doesn't matter in shogi.

00:01:01.541 --> 00:01:03.251
They're all monsters-to-be.

00:01:03.334 --> 00:01:05.295
Did you meet Mr. Tatsuya through shogi?

00:01:05.378 --> 00:01:06.796
Yes, it's a shogi marriage.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.839
Oh, wow.

00:01:07.922 --> 00:01:10.425
How did Mr. Tatsuya propose to you?

00:01:10.508 --> 00:01:13.303
Oh, I'm too shy.

00:01:15.054 --> 00:01:16.306
It's a secret.

00:01:17.557 --> 00:01:20.310
By the way, my new photobook
will be released soon.

00:01:20.393 --> 00:01:21.728
Please check it out!

00:01:23.438 --> 00:01:26.316
Will you keep playing as a joryu
even after marriage?

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:27.650
What?

00:01:27.734 --> 00:01:30.778
Some fans are hoping
you'll become the first female kishi.

00:01:30.862 --> 00:01:34.532
Though realistically,
that would be very unlikely.

00:01:34.616 --> 00:01:37.035
The shogi world
is full of skilled male players.

00:01:40.496 --> 00:01:41.372
What do you think?

00:01:42.415 --> 00:01:43.875
Well…

00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.960
Me, becoming a kishi?

00:01:46.044 --> 00:01:47.962
There's no way!

00:01:50.256 --> 00:01:51.549
Please show us your ring.

00:01:51.633 --> 00:01:54.135
She's competing too…

00:01:56.262 --> 00:01:58.514
Could you look this way?

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:00.850
Thank you so much.

00:02:06.606 --> 00:02:10.693
SOKEI CUP ROOKIE LEAGUE DAY ONE

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.681
SAYURI KIMURA VS. ASUKA KUNIMI

00:02:39.764 --> 00:02:41.015
I resign.

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:44.644
She did it!

00:02:50.566 --> 00:02:52.151
YUNA HAYAMI VS. CHIHIRO TAKAHAMA

00:02:52.235 --> 00:02:53.444
I resign.

00:03:02.078 --> 00:03:04.372
Yuna Hayami is retiring?

00:03:04.455 --> 00:03:08.584
Yeah. She's going to quit
once the marriage is sealed.

00:03:08.668 --> 00:03:11.838
I'd say she was just
a short-term idol player after all…

00:03:12.714 --> 00:03:14.549
if she wasn't the real deal.

00:03:14.632 --> 00:03:16.968
Her strength is real.

00:03:24.017 --> 00:03:25.184
She's strong.

00:03:25.268 --> 00:03:29.230
Yeah. Despite her looks,
her style is very by the book.

00:03:29.313 --> 00:03:30.982
What do you mean?

00:03:31.065 --> 00:03:33.651
It shows that she's relentlessly
dedicated to shogi.

00:04:02.805 --> 00:04:06.309
Maybe Asuka didn't want us around.

00:04:07.226 --> 00:04:09.604
-You think?
-Yeah.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.734
This time,
she's even more fired up than usual.

00:04:14.817 --> 00:04:17.278
Didn't you see today?

00:04:17.362 --> 00:04:18.363
See what?

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.032
Her outfit!

00:04:21.866 --> 00:04:23.034
What about her outfit?

00:04:23.117 --> 00:04:25.078
She looked different!

00:04:26.037 --> 00:04:27.497
Really?

00:04:28.164 --> 00:04:30.750
Men are truly hopeless.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.339
She saved up the prize money
and her pay from my place

00:04:37.006 --> 00:04:39.717
to buy new clothes.

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:43.805
Usually, she just borrows mine.

00:04:46.891 --> 00:04:48.226
Well…

00:04:49.143 --> 00:04:51.312
Sometimes, I wonder…

00:04:53.064 --> 00:04:55.983
if this is the right path for her.

00:04:59.237 --> 00:05:02.156
I mean, with the whole "revenge" thing.

00:05:04.283 --> 00:05:09.330
Girls at her age usually want to
enjoy a more glamorous life, right?

00:05:10.748 --> 00:05:13.251
Like that Yuna Hayami.

00:05:23.511 --> 00:05:25.012
Asuka's outfit today was…

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.765
so cute.

00:05:32.854 --> 00:05:34.647
Is that my game record?

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.235
Oh. Yes.

00:05:39.318 --> 00:05:41.904
Whoa, scary. You're studying me.

00:05:45.867 --> 00:05:48.578
Wait, does that mean…

00:05:48.661 --> 00:05:51.414
you're planning to clear the league?

00:05:51.497 --> 00:05:54.792
Yes, and I will beat you in the final--

00:05:54.876 --> 00:05:57.003
I didn't ask about that.

00:05:59.881 --> 00:06:00.965
Sorry.

00:06:03.968 --> 00:06:07.930
But you know, even if you beat me…

00:06:08.014 --> 00:06:09.724
Hypothetically, I mean.

00:06:09.807 --> 00:06:10.892
What's next?

00:06:14.353 --> 00:06:15.771
I'll become a kishi…

00:06:17.815 --> 00:06:20.026
and beat Shoichi Yuuki.

00:06:28.075 --> 00:06:29.076
I see.

00:06:31.078 --> 00:06:31.913
Yes.

00:06:48.638 --> 00:06:49.597
So…

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.974
What?

00:06:53.392 --> 00:06:54.769
Are you really…

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:56.646
retiring?

00:06:58.439 --> 00:06:59.732
What's with you?

00:07:01.025 --> 00:07:03.110
But you're so strong.

00:07:05.947 --> 00:07:07.365
Strong?

00:07:08.574 --> 00:07:09.909
Me?

00:07:13.287 --> 00:07:14.163
Do you…

00:07:15.706 --> 00:07:17.500
really believe that?

00:07:26.968 --> 00:07:28.928
Sorry, forget it.

00:07:30.763 --> 00:07:32.139
Good night.

00:07:36.102 --> 00:07:37.478
Good night.

00:08:11.971 --> 00:08:17.768
SOKEI CUP ROOKIE LEAGUE DAY TWO

00:08:45.087 --> 00:08:48.799
How did I know that he was the one?
That's a hard question.

00:08:48.883 --> 00:08:53.054
Why don't you ask me
about tomorrow's finals instead?

00:08:55.806 --> 00:08:57.099
It's Asuka Kunimi!

00:08:57.183 --> 00:08:58.601
-Ms. Kunimi!
-What?

00:08:58.684 --> 00:09:00.728
-Congratulations on being a finalist!
-Oh.

00:09:03.606 --> 00:09:05.149
Thank you.

00:09:05.232 --> 00:09:08.194
As of today, you have eight wins
in the official matches.

00:09:08.694 --> 00:09:09.528
Yes.

00:09:09.612 --> 00:09:11.822
Are you aiming for the
kishi admission test?

00:09:11.906 --> 00:09:15.451
-Oh, yes.
-You could be the very first female kishi!

00:09:15.534 --> 00:09:18.079
What about it?

00:09:18.788 --> 00:09:20.831
How does it feel to be making history?

00:09:22.833 --> 00:09:24.794
Well…

00:09:27.296 --> 00:09:28.881
-Come with me.
-What?

00:09:31.842 --> 00:09:34.220
-Get in!
-What? Oh, okay.

00:09:34.303 --> 00:09:35.513
Just a few words please!

00:09:35.596 --> 00:09:37.556
-Please start driving.
-Sure.

00:09:40.601 --> 00:09:41.894
Ms. Kunimi!

00:09:41.977 --> 00:09:43.312
A word please!

00:09:43.396 --> 00:09:44.939
-One comment!
-Please!

00:09:45.022 --> 00:09:46.357
Give us a minute!

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:49.318
Thanks.

00:09:49.402 --> 00:09:52.571
Those flies are so annoying.

00:10:00.746 --> 00:10:02.331
So, where are we going?

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.335
Hang out with me for a bit.

00:10:06.836 --> 00:10:07.795
What?

00:10:22.143 --> 00:10:23.352
Thank you for waiting.

00:10:25.146 --> 00:10:26.355
Here's your drink.

00:10:27.815 --> 00:10:30.568
Sherry. It's their specialty.

00:10:31.235 --> 00:10:33.821
But I don't drink.

00:10:33.904 --> 00:10:37.158
It's nothing. Have a glass with me.

00:10:41.162 --> 00:10:43.038
Since tomorrow will be my last game.

00:10:52.131 --> 00:10:53.257
Cheers.

00:10:54.091 --> 00:10:55.259
Cheers.

00:11:14.236 --> 00:11:15.070
So…

00:11:15.988 --> 00:11:19.325
Are you serious about becoming a kishi?

00:11:20.075 --> 00:11:20.910
I am.

00:11:23.579 --> 00:11:26.957
Do you understand how hard it is?

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.629
-Yes.
-No.

00:11:32.588 --> 00:11:33.964
No, you don't.

00:11:50.689 --> 00:11:53.609
Do you think I'm happy,
playing as a joryu kishi?

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.490
I failed.

00:12:00.824 --> 00:12:03.869
I started training in the Shoreikai
ever since I was a child.

00:12:03.953 --> 00:12:06.247
I dreamed of becoming a kishi.

00:12:08.541 --> 00:12:10.793
But I couldn't beat those monsters.

00:12:14.755 --> 00:12:16.465
I'm a woman after all.

00:12:17.633 --> 00:12:19.552
There's a wall I can't overcome.

00:12:31.689 --> 00:12:33.107
What a waste.

00:12:35.025 --> 00:12:35.859
What?

00:12:35.943 --> 00:12:37.653
You're really strong.

00:12:39.363 --> 00:12:43.158
Hey. Stop talking
like you know everything.

00:12:44.952 --> 00:12:47.079
You don't understand the reality yet.

00:12:47.788 --> 00:12:49.123
Reality?

00:12:49.915 --> 00:12:52.376
Women can only go so far.

00:12:52.459 --> 00:12:54.461
You'll see it one day.

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:57.881
I doubt it.

00:12:58.757 --> 00:12:59.592
What?

00:13:01.468 --> 00:13:02.970
Maybe that day…

00:13:03.929 --> 00:13:05.139
will never come.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:08.976
Well…

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:15.649
I'm really just speaking my mind.

00:13:15.733 --> 00:13:17.109
Are you mocking me?

00:13:18.611 --> 00:13:20.070
I'm not.

00:13:23.532 --> 00:13:25.784
I knew it. You're crazy in the head.

00:13:26.285 --> 00:13:27.453
What do you mean?

00:13:27.536 --> 00:13:31.081
It's not normal to try to kill someone.

00:13:35.294 --> 00:13:36.795
I've given up on that.

00:13:38.631 --> 00:13:40.341
Someone told me that

00:13:41.717 --> 00:13:44.303
you can't kill a kishi with a knife.

00:13:45.262 --> 00:13:48.849
You can only kill them with shogi.

00:13:50.809 --> 00:13:51.810
What?

00:13:53.228 --> 00:13:58.067
So, you're planning to become a kishi
to beat Shoichi Yuuki?

00:13:58.776 --> 00:13:59.610
Yes.

00:14:00.194 --> 00:14:01.820
I'll kill him with shogi.

00:14:05.949 --> 00:14:08.160
You're seriously deranged.

00:14:10.412 --> 00:14:12.915
How could you win against Shoichi Yuuki?

00:14:14.541 --> 00:14:16.502
He's at the very top of the shogi world.

00:14:18.837 --> 00:14:20.130
Why not?

00:14:24.009 --> 00:14:28.055
We never know if we will win or lose.

00:14:33.519 --> 00:14:35.562
This is going nowhere.

00:14:37.147 --> 00:14:39.316
You just don't get it.

00:14:43.445 --> 00:14:44.697
But I've decided.

00:14:48.617 --> 00:14:50.786
I'll destroy you tomorrow.

00:14:56.917 --> 00:14:58.794
I look forward to it.

00:15:14.893 --> 00:15:16.895
Welcome back. You stayed out late.

00:15:22.901 --> 00:15:24.862
He was up waiting.

00:15:26.905 --> 00:15:29.241
Was he upset?

00:15:32.619 --> 00:15:34.538
He wanted you to rest.

00:15:51.305 --> 00:15:54.308
Does the reception seating chart
look okay to you?

00:15:58.979 --> 00:16:01.065
Are you listening, Yuna?

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:07.738
What if I said I don't want to retire?

00:16:09.615 --> 00:16:10.491
What?

00:16:12.868 --> 00:16:17.164
Just kidding.
Let's sort out the seating chart.

00:16:25.047 --> 00:16:25.881
Ms. Kunimi!

00:16:25.964 --> 00:16:27.758
Congratulations on being a finalist!

00:16:27.841 --> 00:16:28.759
What?

00:16:28.842 --> 00:16:31.470
ASUKA KUNIMI DETERMINED
TO BECOME THE FIRST FEMALE KISHI

00:16:31.553 --> 00:16:32.930
Thank you.

00:16:33.013 --> 00:16:35.808
As of today, you have eight wins
in the official matches.

00:16:36.433 --> 00:16:37.434
Yes.

00:16:37.935 --> 00:16:39.853
Are you aiming for the
kishi admission test?

00:16:39.937 --> 00:16:40.771
Oh, yes.

00:16:40.854 --> 00:16:42.898
You could be the very first female kishi!

00:16:44.399 --> 00:16:46.693
What about it?

00:16:46.777 --> 00:16:48.779
How does it feel to be making history?

00:16:53.492 --> 00:16:57.079
DAY THREE FINALS

00:17:49.756 --> 00:17:53.844
As it is the scheduled time,
please begin the game.

00:17:57.514 --> 00:17:59.016
-Let's have a good match.
-Yes.

00:18:09.401 --> 00:18:10.903
ROOK

00:18:17.159 --> 00:18:19.453
Hey. What's going on?

00:18:19.953 --> 00:18:22.456
Yuna Hayami is leading at this point.

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:24.166
What?

00:18:24.666 --> 00:18:26.335
She's changed.

00:18:46.772 --> 00:18:48.815
Asuka Kunimi, one minute remaining.

00:18:57.616 --> 00:18:58.951
Good.

00:19:49.626 --> 00:19:51.461
She has stopped playing by the book.

00:19:52.921 --> 00:19:54.006
Is that bad?

00:19:54.631 --> 00:19:55.674
No.

00:19:56.341 --> 00:19:57.801
This is getting interesting!

00:19:58.802 --> 00:20:01.763
A straight-up fist fight. It's her thing.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.632
YUNA HAYAMI VS. ASUKA KUNIMI

00:20:38.216 --> 00:20:40.969
Tatsuya, have you seen your dad?

00:20:41.053 --> 00:20:43.013
No, I haven't.

00:20:43.555 --> 00:20:44.598
Why?

00:20:45.223 --> 00:20:47.351
He missed the board meeting today.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.282
Hey, is that the chairman?

00:21:02.366 --> 00:21:04.368
-Oh, wow.
-You're right, it is.

00:21:04.451 --> 00:21:05.952
-Why is he here?
-Did you know?

00:21:06.036 --> 00:21:07.621
No, I didn't.

00:21:07.704 --> 00:21:09.623
No one told me anything.

00:21:11.208 --> 00:21:13.043
-What's the matter?
-Why did he come?

00:21:13.752 --> 00:21:16.004
He never shows up at games like this…

00:21:17.839 --> 00:21:21.259
I found where Dad is.

00:21:21.343 --> 00:21:23.261
What? Where?

00:21:23.762 --> 00:21:24.805
Look…

00:21:27.182 --> 00:21:29.976
SHOICHI YUUKI SHOWED UP.
MR. YUUKI IS AT THE ROOKIE CUP.

00:22:00.215 --> 00:22:02.050
Looks like Asuka's having fun.

00:22:27.617 --> 00:22:31.705
ROOK

00:23:18.126 --> 00:23:19.211
I resign.

00:23:35.936 --> 00:23:38.605
Oh! Uh, thank you very much.

00:24:02.796 --> 00:24:04.130
That was amazing!

00:24:19.104 --> 00:24:20.772
You're leaving without meeting her?

00:24:21.773 --> 00:24:23.316
Hey, wait!

00:24:26.236 --> 00:24:29.447
I remember you. Todou.

00:24:30.031 --> 00:24:32.742
Hey! Stop it!

00:24:32.826 --> 00:24:34.577
Thanks for remembering me.

00:24:35.078 --> 00:24:36.288
I'm honored.

00:24:37.622 --> 00:24:41.751
I see you still care about
the daughter you threw out.

00:24:41.835 --> 00:24:42.836
Yuuki Ho-oh?

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:47.007
Todou, did you train Asuka?

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:48.591
Yes.

00:24:49.759 --> 00:24:51.011
That somehow happened.

00:24:52.178 --> 00:24:53.471
I see.

00:24:54.597 --> 00:24:55.849
That's good.

00:24:57.017 --> 00:24:58.143
What?

00:24:58.727 --> 00:24:59.978
What's good?

00:25:00.562 --> 00:25:03.857
You're the one
who said shogi isn't for me!

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:05.984
Are you pitying us losers for teaming up?

00:25:07.319 --> 00:25:08.778
Hey, it's Chairman Yuuki!

00:25:08.862 --> 00:25:10.447
-This way!
-Over there!

00:25:11.031 --> 00:25:11.865
-Chairman!
-Hey.

00:25:11.948 --> 00:25:13.491
We're not done yet!

00:25:13.575 --> 00:25:15.285
That was a good game.

00:25:18.038 --> 00:25:20.707
Hey Yuuki. Be prepared.

00:25:21.291 --> 00:25:25.587
-The times are changing.
-Sir, a few words on the finals please.

00:25:26.254 --> 00:25:28.131
-What brought you here today?
-Sir!

00:26:12.467 --> 00:26:13.676
Welcome home.

00:26:27.107 --> 00:26:28.400
Today,

00:26:28.983 --> 00:26:31.236
I, Tatsuya Yuuki, and Yuna Hayami,

00:26:32.028 --> 00:26:35.240
are here to share
the news of our engagement.

00:26:37.742 --> 00:26:43.039
We are very pleased to be able to share
the news with you in our own words today.

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:45.583
Once we are officially married,

00:26:45.667 --> 00:26:48.044
I will be retiring
from being a joryu kishi.

00:26:49.129 --> 00:26:53.425
From now on, I will dedicate myself
to supporting my family.

00:26:58.513 --> 00:27:02.225
Maybe she was looking
for a reason to quit.

00:27:03.935 --> 00:27:09.315
Though I'm stepping back,
I'll be supporting Tatsuya as his partner.

00:27:09.983 --> 00:27:14.195
In that way,
I hope to give back to the shogi world.

00:27:14.279 --> 00:27:16.739
What's up? Feeling lonely?

00:27:16.823 --> 00:27:18.783
No, it's not like that.

00:27:18.867 --> 00:27:23.329
The more you win,
the more people you'll eliminate.

00:27:23.955 --> 00:27:25.290
That's what shogi is.

00:27:35.592 --> 00:27:36.718
Hello?

00:27:38.344 --> 00:27:41.681
What? Are you kidding?
I need an explanation--

00:27:43.558 --> 00:27:45.435
They hung up, damn it!

00:27:45.518 --> 00:27:46.978
What's the matter?

00:27:47.061 --> 00:27:48.354
We're banned.

00:27:48.438 --> 00:27:51.566
You've been rejected
from every match we entered you into.

00:27:51.649 --> 00:27:52.859
This is the fifth one.

00:27:52.942 --> 00:27:54.277
Why?

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.237
Someone's pressuring them.

00:27:57.197 --> 00:28:00.200
Someone's telling them to
keep you out of the game.

00:28:01.576 --> 00:28:02.911
Pressure…

00:28:09.834 --> 00:28:10.835
Thank you so much.

00:28:11.336 --> 00:28:12.670
Please look straight ahead.

00:28:20.345 --> 00:28:21.930
This way please.

00:28:36.903 --> 00:28:39.614
Why're you interfering when
the very first female kishi is emerging?

00:28:39.697 --> 00:28:41.741
I'm just playing the best move.

00:28:41.825 --> 00:28:45.119
The disciple you once failed
to make a kishi is interfering.

00:28:45.203 --> 00:28:46.371
Kaori Yuuki.

00:28:46.454 --> 00:28:48.373
Wouldn't you like to see
the very first female kishi?

00:28:48.456 --> 00:28:52.001
Why do you want to become a kishi?

00:28:52.085 --> 00:28:54.337
To fight against this shitty world.

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:56.506
Age? Gender?

00:28:56.589 --> 00:28:57.966
None of that matters, does it?

00:28:58.049 --> 00:29:01.427
I'll use everyone as a stepping stone
and rise above.

00:29:01.511 --> 00:29:02.387
