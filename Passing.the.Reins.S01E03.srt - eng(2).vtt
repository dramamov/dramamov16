WEBVTT

00:00:06.711 --> 00:00:08.546
I want to win
the nation's top Grade I race

00:00:08.613 --> 00:00:10.515
and make our horse the best in Japan.

00:00:10.582 --> 00:00:11.716
At the Arima Kinen.

00:00:11.783 --> 00:00:13.084
Understood.

00:00:13.151 --> 00:00:15.587
Eiji Kurisu left
a major tax accounting firm

00:00:16.154 --> 00:00:20.492
to join Royal Human President
Kozo Sanno's Horse Racing Division

00:00:20.558 --> 00:00:21.993
as his private secretary.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.761
Win one central race within the year.

00:00:23.828 --> 00:00:25.530
If you can't win even once,

00:00:25.597 --> 00:00:28.166
the department will be abolished
by the year's end.

00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:30.668
Kurisu and Sanno
placed their hopes on Royal Fight,

00:00:30.735 --> 00:00:33.671
who was in good form
after coming in second place,

00:00:33.738 --> 00:00:37.909
and entrusted the challenge
to a new trainer, Hiroshi Hironaka.

00:00:37.976 --> 00:00:42.147
But the one who caught Hironaka's eye
was a maiden horse the same age as Fight,

00:00:42.213 --> 00:00:44.816
born at the Hayashida Ranch, Royal Izana.

00:00:44.883 --> 00:00:46.584
Royal Fight and Royal Izana…

00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:48.019
I'd like to switch them around.

00:00:48.086 --> 00:00:50.588
I really believe we can win this way.

00:00:50.655 --> 00:00:52.056
-Do it.
-Izana!

00:00:52.123 --> 00:00:53.625
Hang in there!

00:00:53.691 --> 00:00:54.692
Go!

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:56.995
-Go!
-Run, Izana!

00:00:57.562 --> 00:01:00.999
Izana showed her aptitude
on the turf course and won.

00:01:01.065 --> 00:01:03.001
It saved the Horse Racing Division, but…

00:01:03.067 --> 00:01:04.502
We did it, President!

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:05.637
You're a great team.

00:01:05.703 --> 00:01:07.739
A team? We're nothing so fancy.

00:01:07.805 --> 00:01:08.773
THE ROYAL FAMILY BEGINS

00:01:14.846 --> 00:01:17.148
Kanako, that's unacceptable!

00:01:17.882 --> 00:01:20.151
I'm sorry for my father's rudeness!

00:01:20.218 --> 00:01:21.586
"Do you even want to win?"

00:01:21.653 --> 00:01:23.688
Every horse owner wants to win!

00:01:23.755 --> 00:01:24.889
He's so rude!

00:01:24.956 --> 00:01:26.057
I'm truly sorry.

00:01:26.124 --> 00:01:28.960
I will make him apologize.
Please, give us one more chance.

00:01:29.027 --> 00:01:30.495
I'm sorry to say this,

00:01:30.562 --> 00:01:34.232
but Hidaka ranches are not
in a position to be picky right now!

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.368
Hokuryo Farm has countless
good horses on offer!

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:39.771
Just shut up and sell horses!

00:01:40.305 --> 00:01:42.974
Or your tiny farm will be ruined!

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.883
Please, people's livelihoods
are at stake here!

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.218
I know.

00:01:53.284 --> 00:01:55.153
NOZAKI FARM, RANCH OWNER

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.821
This one is the last.

00:01:57.422 --> 00:01:59.591
NOZAKI FARM

00:01:59.657 --> 00:02:00.892
Last?

00:02:02.827 --> 00:02:04.229
What do you mean?

00:02:06.931 --> 00:02:08.333
What do you mean by last?

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.434
Hey, welcome back.

00:02:10.435 --> 00:02:11.603
I'm home.

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:13.471
Welcome back. How was school?

00:02:13.538 --> 00:02:14.505
KANAKO'S SON

00:02:18.076 --> 00:02:19.477
Go ahead.

00:02:19.544 --> 00:02:21.946
I don't want to do it. Ask someone else!

00:02:22.013 --> 00:02:23.781
You do it every year!

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:25.416
Right?

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:32.657
Well then,
a toast to Yuriko Sanno's birthday!

00:02:33.424 --> 00:02:35.693
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.662
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

00:02:38.396 --> 00:02:41.332
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:42.233
Thank you.

00:02:43.334 --> 00:02:46.004
Oh, take a picture with me too!
Can I upload it to Facebook?

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.038
Sure!

00:02:49.574 --> 00:02:52.610
-Too bad!
-You should try again.

00:02:53.378 --> 00:02:54.946
I'm frustrated. I'll try again.

00:02:57.081 --> 00:02:58.816
Business is booming, it seems.

00:02:58.883 --> 00:03:01.419
My mother's F&B business.

00:03:01.486 --> 00:03:03.454
I'm glad.

00:03:04.555 --> 00:03:07.425
In the end,
they only won once, didn't they?

00:03:09.694 --> 00:03:13.164
I should have made the condition
two wins within the year.

00:03:13.231 --> 00:03:16.234
Then that Horse Racing Division
would be long gone by now.

00:03:17.402 --> 00:03:21.272
But, Chief, the situation is not so grim.

00:03:21.873 --> 00:03:24.642
Relations with the trainers
and farms are good,

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.345
and everyone is sure
that results will come this year.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.148
They're sure, huh?

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:36.587
Gambling addicts always say that.

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.491
Kurisu, where have you been?

00:03:40.558 --> 00:03:41.793
Wait.

00:03:42.393 --> 00:03:43.328
What?

00:03:43.895 --> 00:03:45.997
Okay, come on.

00:03:46.064 --> 00:03:47.098
Here.

00:03:47.165 --> 00:03:48.366
Use this.

00:03:48.433 --> 00:03:49.734
Would you like some water?

00:03:49.801 --> 00:03:51.235
No, no need.

00:03:53.338 --> 00:03:55.740
Gosh, it's rare for him to be this drunk.

00:04:02.613 --> 00:04:04.682
It's fine. He's just sleeping.

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.925
-Here you go.
-Oh, uh…

00:04:14.492 --> 00:04:15.860
Thank you very much.

00:04:20.598 --> 00:04:24.001
Do you know what made Kozo
start horse racing?

00:04:24.769 --> 00:04:26.037
Well… No.

00:04:26.604 --> 00:04:28.840
My father recommended it.

00:04:28.906 --> 00:04:30.908
My father was a horse owner too.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.015
I hate horses, but I hated my father more.

00:04:38.649 --> 00:04:41.018
He was self-righteous and domineering.

00:04:41.085 --> 00:04:45.189
Whenever the horses lost,
he would blame it on my mother.

00:04:48.192 --> 00:04:51.462
Then this man stumbled into that world.

00:04:52.597 --> 00:04:54.665
He was a timid person,

00:04:55.366 --> 00:04:58.569
and my father provided
his company's funds,

00:04:59.103 --> 00:05:01.739
so he couldn't refuse.

00:05:03.875 --> 00:05:07.445
The day he first bought a horse,

00:05:08.045 --> 00:05:12.250
I saw my father in Kozo's proud smile.

00:05:13.951 --> 00:05:16.220
And I almost fainted.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.062
Injuries are part of the game,

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.466
but for them both to get hurt
at the same time…

00:05:29.033 --> 00:05:31.469
They're still young enough to race,
and yet…

00:05:31.536 --> 00:05:32.804
I know.

00:05:33.571 --> 00:05:36.374
But we can't risk even worse injuries.

00:05:38.943 --> 00:05:40.378
Although they didn't win big,

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:45.249
Fight and Izana
absolutely saved our division.

00:05:46.017 --> 00:05:47.952
When Izana won,

00:05:48.653 --> 00:05:52.123
I thought we could just keep
progressing to bigger races.

00:05:52.924 --> 00:05:55.793
But it really is a distant goal, isn't it?

00:05:56.327 --> 00:05:57.195
The Arima Kinen.

00:06:00.131 --> 00:06:03.100
That said, there's no need to be sad.

00:06:03.167 --> 00:06:04.535
Our next challenge.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.472
The auction?

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.745
Right now, all the top horses
are from the Hokuryo farm.

00:06:14.812 --> 00:06:16.547
That can't be denied.

00:06:18.783 --> 00:06:21.052
Read through this.

00:06:22.153 --> 00:06:24.655
We must get a horse at the auction.

00:06:25.523 --> 00:06:29.727
Also, I want to stop by the Hayashida
Ranch to check on the breeding.

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:32.930
Understood.

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:36.267
The Hidaka region.

00:06:36.334 --> 00:06:39.170
Nestled between the majestic
Hidaka Range and the Pacific Ocean,

00:06:39.237 --> 00:06:43.407
this land, lush with nature
is home to many thoroughbred ranches.

00:06:44.342 --> 00:06:49.413
From as far back as the Meiji era,
it has produced numerous racehorses.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.782
It is Japan's premier breeding ground.

00:06:52.283 --> 00:06:56.254
However, most Hidaka ranches
are individually owned,

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.323
and over time, due to Japan's
generally declining population,

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.093
and a lack of successors to take over,

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:05.363
the number of breeding ranches
has halved in the last century,

00:07:05.429 --> 00:07:07.131
following a trend of decline.

00:07:08.165 --> 00:07:10.801
Meanwhile, a few large-scale ranches,

00:07:10.868 --> 00:07:14.138
by managing everything
from breeding to training horses,

00:07:14.705 --> 00:07:18.709
have claimed great results in both
the number of horses and their winnings.

00:07:19.677 --> 00:07:24.415
Right now, farm management
is undergoing a major shift.

00:07:25.616 --> 00:07:29.086
ROYAL HAPPINESS

00:07:29.153 --> 00:07:32.790
SPECIAL SONIC (BORN 1997)

00:07:32.857 --> 00:07:35.526
They're all fathered
by horses even I know.

00:07:39.997 --> 00:07:42.033
Do you like horses?

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.901
A bit.

00:07:44.402 --> 00:07:46.003
Sorry to take up your time.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.105
No. It's a nice change of pace.

00:07:48.172 --> 00:07:50.474
Welcome. Here you go.

00:07:53.578 --> 00:07:55.846
Oh, this is…

00:07:55.913 --> 00:07:57.682
It's fine. Don't be so awkward.

00:07:57.748 --> 00:08:00.418
Everyone wants a horse from Hokuryo Farm.

00:08:01.152 --> 00:08:02.954
The auction is next week, huh?

00:08:03.487 --> 00:08:05.256
How about you? How's business?

00:08:05.823 --> 00:08:06.991
A complete failure.

00:08:07.058 --> 00:08:09.827
I just can't find a buyer.

00:08:09.894 --> 00:08:11.862
VASILITINO
SOLEIL BRIGHT

00:08:11.929 --> 00:08:13.197
Really?

00:08:13.264 --> 00:08:15.600
Doesn't the Hidaka auction
start next month?

00:08:16.133 --> 00:08:18.336
If you put one up,
it will garner interest.

00:08:20.471 --> 00:08:21.305
What?

00:08:21.372 --> 00:08:24.675
We have one horse,
but my father won't put it up.

00:08:25.476 --> 00:08:26.477
Really?

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:29.814
Yes.

00:08:30.448 --> 00:08:33.317
In an auction,
a starting price is set, right?

00:08:33.384 --> 00:08:34.785
-Yes.
-Right.

00:08:35.486 --> 00:08:38.055
A number that says,
"You must pay at least this much."

00:08:38.122 --> 00:08:41.892
So, at the very least,
you can recoup the costs of raising them.

00:08:41.959 --> 00:08:43.761
Yes, roughly like that.

00:08:44.295 --> 00:08:47.565
In exchange, at an auction,
you don't know who gets the horse.

00:08:48.132 --> 00:08:51.369
In an auction, you must hand
the horse to the highest bidder,

00:08:51.435 --> 00:08:53.137
no matter who they are.

00:08:53.204 --> 00:08:54.071
Right.

00:08:55.106 --> 00:08:57.141
My father doesn't like that.

00:08:57.875 --> 00:09:03.314
He wants to talk directly with the owners
and only sell to the right person.

00:09:03.381 --> 00:09:05.216
Oh, that's noble.

00:09:05.816 --> 00:09:07.818
I can understand his feelings.

00:09:08.352 --> 00:09:13.724
As a buyer, if the ranch is so picky,
I would have high hopes for the horse.

00:09:14.392 --> 00:09:15.393
Do you think so?

00:09:15.459 --> 00:09:16.293
I do.

00:09:17.862 --> 00:09:19.497
Even if the horse costs 100 million?

00:09:20.965 --> 00:09:22.566
100 million…

00:09:25.036 --> 00:09:29.340
At the Hokuryo Farm auction,
100 million is small change.

00:09:29.907 --> 00:09:33.411
But a small Hidaka ranch asking
for 100 million yen in a private sale

00:09:33.477 --> 00:09:34.879
is practically a joke.

00:09:35.446 --> 00:09:38.315
Even so, some people
were somewhat interested,

00:09:39.116 --> 00:09:41.485
but my father kept refusing.

00:09:43.521 --> 00:09:45.022
That horse…

00:09:46.357 --> 00:09:47.224
What kind is it?

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.495
-What's wrong?
-No…

00:09:52.363 --> 00:09:54.098
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:09:54.665 --> 00:09:56.767
I didn't come here to… Wait…

00:09:56.834 --> 00:09:59.437
I'm not here to ask you
to get Mr. Sanno to buy the horse.

00:09:59.503 --> 00:10:00.538
I mean it!

00:10:01.105 --> 00:10:01.939
I just…

00:10:02.573 --> 00:10:05.242
-I wanted you to listen to my complaints.
-I know.

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:09.146
Trust me, I'm not interested
because it's you.

00:10:09.847 --> 00:10:12.316
We're looking for a new horse too.

00:10:17.421 --> 00:10:20.791
Hokuryo Farm has all the facilities
needed for thoroughbreds,

00:10:20.858 --> 00:10:27.031
including breeding, rearing,
training, and stallion management.

00:10:27.598 --> 00:10:30.534
They trade hundreds of horses annually.

00:10:30.601 --> 00:10:32.903
It is the largest ranch in Japan.

00:10:37.475 --> 00:10:39.944
Hello! I've been waiting for you!

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:41.912
-Pleasure doing business.
-Yes.

00:10:41.979 --> 00:10:43.447
Do you have a horse in mind?

00:10:43.514 --> 00:10:46.350
-Oh, you look like you do.
-No, I'll have to see them first.

00:10:46.417 --> 00:10:49.320
Really? You look like a man
with a target already!

00:10:49.887 --> 00:10:53.691
For the horse Mr. Sanno wants,
I fear we will have stiff competition.

00:10:53.758 --> 00:10:56.761
-You sure about this?
-What do you think, Mr. Hironaka?

00:10:56.827 --> 00:10:58.829
It is certainly a well-bred horse.

00:10:59.396 --> 00:11:01.732
Anyone would expect it to win.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.503
But that doesn't fit
the president's style.

00:11:06.103 --> 00:11:07.571
I think so too.

00:11:08.105 --> 00:11:10.074
The horse is certainly good.

00:11:10.141 --> 00:11:13.177
But I wonder
if it's really the right choice.

00:11:14.044 --> 00:11:18.082
Fight and Izana were both rare finds,
discovered by Mr. Sanno.

00:11:19.116 --> 00:11:20.584
You're really speaking up now.

00:11:20.651 --> 00:11:21.986
No, I didn't mean to…

00:11:23.187 --> 00:11:26.824
But right now,
Hokuryo is dominant in every aspect.

00:11:26.891 --> 00:11:30.594
To have better odds, he must either
get a horse with an excellent pedigree

00:11:31.162 --> 00:11:32.596
or go against the tide

00:11:32.663 --> 00:11:35.099
and discover an as-yet-unknown
promising horse.

00:11:35.166 --> 00:11:38.402
He also has difficult choices to make.

00:11:40.171 --> 00:11:44.441
Next is No. 142. Born to Golden Rail and…

00:11:44.508 --> 00:11:46.911
I think this next horse is interesting.

00:11:48.445 --> 00:11:49.980
A mare, huh?

00:11:50.047 --> 00:11:51.782
Its pedigree excels at 1600 meters.

00:11:51.849 --> 00:11:54.151
If you choose the races,
it could be a contender.

00:11:54.218 --> 00:11:55.085
President?

00:11:55.619 --> 00:11:56.453
No.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.656
The goal is the Arima Kinen,
not the 1600 meters.

00:11:59.757 --> 00:12:01.792
The Arima Kinen, Kozo's dream,

00:12:01.859 --> 00:12:04.395
requires a tough horse
that can run long distances

00:12:04.461 --> 00:12:06.397
to have a chance at the top spots.

00:12:06.463 --> 00:12:08.899
Last call. 97 million yen.

00:12:08.966 --> 00:12:09.934
Any bids?

00:12:11.402 --> 00:12:14.271
-Sold for 96 million.
-Our target is the Seal brown one.

00:12:15.439 --> 00:12:17.374
Seeing it in person determined it.

00:12:17.441 --> 00:12:19.810
Thank you for your winning bid.

00:12:20.711 --> 00:12:23.013
Sorry. I can't say anything yet.

00:12:23.614 --> 00:12:25.316
Mr. Sanno's favorite is coming up.

00:12:25.382 --> 00:12:26.417
Got it.

00:12:26.917 --> 00:12:28.152
Sorry to make you do this.

00:12:28.219 --> 00:12:29.320
It's fine.

00:12:29.386 --> 00:12:30.754
And, besides…

00:12:31.555 --> 00:12:36.227
Depending on the bid price,
he may choose to just buy this horse.

00:12:36.861 --> 00:12:40.431
The presale rumors alone say
it will exceed 100 million yen.

00:12:40.497 --> 00:12:42.700
We're also on a budget.

00:12:43.267 --> 00:12:44.301
It's okay.

00:12:45.069 --> 00:12:47.137
But… I see.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:53.611
I want him to win the bid,
but I also don't want him to.

00:12:54.278 --> 00:12:55.613
It's complicated.

00:12:56.881 --> 00:13:01.518
Of course, if we can't win the bid here,
we plan to visit ranches later.

00:13:08.592 --> 00:13:09.860
Sorry, I have to go.

00:13:12.763 --> 00:13:16.367
Next up is lot number 151.

00:13:16.934 --> 00:13:21.939
Black Flash, born March 15th 2011.
Male, Seal brown.

00:13:22.006 --> 00:13:24.108
Fathered by Disc Eye.

00:13:24.174 --> 00:13:26.510
The stud we've all been
waiting for is here!

00:13:27.111 --> 00:13:29.246
All right! 190 million yen?

00:13:29.313 --> 00:13:31.115
Can we get 200 million?

00:13:31.181 --> 00:13:33.284
-200 million?
-Yes!

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:34.852
210 million yen?

00:13:34.919 --> 00:13:35.819
210 million yen.

00:13:35.886 --> 00:13:36.921
220 million yen?

00:13:37.588 --> 00:13:38.989
230 million yen?

00:13:39.056 --> 00:13:40.557
The owner on the first row.

00:13:40.624 --> 00:13:44.061
-240 million?
-Yes!

00:13:44.128 --> 00:13:45.129
240 million.

00:13:45.195 --> 00:13:48.299
250 million?

00:13:48.365 --> 00:13:50.567
-Yes!
-250 million.

00:13:50.634 --> 00:13:52.503
-260 million?
-Yes!

00:13:52.569 --> 00:13:53.404
260 million.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:55.172
-270 million?
-President.

00:13:55.239 --> 00:13:57.107
We're 100 million over budget.

00:13:57.174 --> 00:13:58.042
Are you sure…

00:13:58.108 --> 00:13:58.943
-Yes!
-270 million.

00:13:59.977 --> 00:14:02.246
-280 million?
-Yes!

00:14:02.313 --> 00:14:03.314
280 million.

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:04.915
-290 million?
-Yes!

00:14:04.982 --> 00:14:05.816
290 million.

00:14:05.883 --> 00:14:07.885
-300 million yen?
-Yes!

00:14:07.952 --> 00:14:08.886
300 million yen.

00:14:08.953 --> 00:14:11.188
We've reached the milestone
of 300 million yen.

00:14:11.755 --> 00:14:13.857
Do I have 310 million yen?

00:14:13.924 --> 00:14:17.094
310 million yen?

00:14:17.161 --> 00:14:19.563
-A stud with a strong sire.
-President.

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:21.332
-We can't afford…
-310 million?

00:14:21.398 --> 00:14:22.299
Yes!

00:14:22.833 --> 00:14:24.468
310 million yen.

00:14:25.135 --> 00:14:27.671
320 million yen?

00:14:27.738 --> 00:14:29.440
-Yes!
-320 million yen.

00:14:29.974 --> 00:14:32.176
Do I have 330 million?

00:14:32.242 --> 00:14:35.012
330 million yen?

00:14:35.079 --> 00:14:37.848
Soon, we'll have our last call.

00:14:37.915 --> 00:14:39.950
Do I have 330 million yen?

00:14:41.618 --> 00:14:43.554
330 million yen, last call.

00:14:44.421 --> 00:14:47.057
No bids for 330 million yen?

00:14:50.527 --> 00:14:54.164
It goes to the owner by
Spotter Sugiyama for 320 million yen.

00:15:02.806 --> 00:15:07.478
Horses purchased at the Hokuryo auction
will spend their time there

00:15:07.544 --> 00:15:10.314
until they become full-fledged racehorses.

00:15:11.582 --> 00:15:14.785
In human terms, this place
is like a prestigious boarding school.

00:15:15.386 --> 00:15:17.388
If you consider their debut
as entering the workforce,

00:15:17.454 --> 00:15:21.859
then that horse is a super elite,
who has had the best education possible

00:15:21.925 --> 00:15:24.061
from kindergarten to university.

00:15:24.561 --> 00:15:26.764
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

00:15:28.732 --> 00:15:29.967
Mr. Hironaka.

00:15:30.034 --> 00:15:32.436
Congratulations on winning the other day.

00:15:32.503 --> 00:15:34.505
-The Japanese Derby.
-Thank you.

00:15:35.072 --> 00:15:35.906
Hironaka!

00:15:36.573 --> 00:15:37.708
Hello.

00:15:38.642 --> 00:15:40.010
This is Hokuryo's CEO.

00:15:40.077 --> 00:15:42.079
-Oh, hello, sir.
-Hello.

00:15:42.613 --> 00:15:43.447
Where's Mr. Sanno?

00:15:43.514 --> 00:15:45.215
He's working on the next strategy.

00:15:45.716 --> 00:15:49.119
Mr. Sanno always
livens things up every year.

00:15:49.186 --> 00:15:50.788
We're grateful. I'm Nomura.

00:15:51.922 --> 00:15:52.956
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

00:15:53.023 --> 00:15:54.258
My pleasure.

00:15:54.925 --> 00:15:58.328
I now need you to buy
another ten horses, Mr. Shiina.

00:15:58.395 --> 00:16:00.531
We still have to check out other ranches.

00:16:00.597 --> 00:16:02.366
-Oh, that's right. Hironaka.
-Yes?

00:16:02.433 --> 00:16:04.601
I would like to introduce you to someone.

00:16:04.668 --> 00:16:05.769
Oh, okay.

00:16:05.836 --> 00:16:07.571
Excuse us then.

00:16:07.638 --> 00:16:09.673
Have fun. This way.

00:16:13.177 --> 00:16:17.181
I won the bid for Akino Lily
who just won the Japan Derby, here.

00:16:18.282 --> 00:16:20.751
In a one-on-one bidding war
with Mr. Sanno.

00:16:23.087 --> 00:16:25.022
My first thought after I won

00:16:25.622 --> 00:16:28.625
was how glad I was
not to have lost the bid to anyone.

00:16:31.361 --> 00:16:35.732
I feel sorry for Mr. Sanno,
but because we had that bidding war,

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.936
my faith in Akino Lily became unshakable.

00:16:40.838 --> 00:16:44.308
Thanks to him, they're the best in Japan.

00:16:46.677 --> 00:16:49.379
Please pass along my thanks.

00:16:51.315 --> 00:16:52.749
Understood.

00:17:05.462 --> 00:17:07.998
Why didn't you go with your friends?

00:17:08.065 --> 00:17:11.335
They said the car
would take two hours to fix.

00:17:11.401 --> 00:17:13.237
And I knew you were here.

00:17:13.303 --> 00:17:16.173
We have a lot of places
we need to go to, you know?

00:17:17.808 --> 00:17:19.643
-Oh, is that her?
-Where?

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:21.712
Oh, there. There she is.

00:17:21.778 --> 00:17:22.613
Gosh.

00:17:22.679 --> 00:17:24.448
HAYASHIDA RANCH

00:17:26.517 --> 00:17:29.253
-Oh, no! I'm scared!
-Yuriko.

00:17:29.319 --> 00:17:30.154
Scary!

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:32.789
-Oh, they're cute from further away.
-Yuriko!

00:17:33.557 --> 00:17:35.459
-They're cute further away.
-Sorry.

00:17:35.959 --> 00:17:38.495
-I didn't mean to bring her here.
-Oh, it's fine.

00:17:38.562 --> 00:17:40.597
Look. Happiness is doing fine like always.

00:17:40.664 --> 00:17:43.100
Oh, look at that coat she has!

00:17:43.167 --> 00:17:44.768
What? Is this horse Happiness?

00:17:44.835 --> 00:17:46.270
Royal Happiness?

00:17:46.336 --> 00:17:48.372
She won a big race once, right?

00:17:48.438 --> 00:17:50.807
-What was it?
-Nakayama Himba Stakes, a G3.

00:17:50.874 --> 00:17:52.009
I knew it.

00:17:52.509 --> 00:17:55.712
He kept going on
about Happiness back then.

00:17:55.779 --> 00:17:57.614
But he never let us see her.

00:17:58.215 --> 00:18:01.118
He never lets us see the good parts!

00:18:01.185 --> 00:18:03.287
You're weird, Dad.

00:18:03.353 --> 00:18:05.889
You're the ones that never came
when I asked you to!

00:18:05.956 --> 00:18:08.892
Royal Happiness, owned by Kozo Sanno,

00:18:08.959 --> 00:18:12.596
is a broodmare,
a female horse used to produce foals.

00:18:13.764 --> 00:18:16.133
Horses that performed well
during their careers

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:20.604
or have excellent pedigrees
are often returned to a breeding ranch

00:18:20.671 --> 00:18:24.341
to live out their lives
as a mother horse for breeding.

00:18:24.408 --> 00:18:25.242
President.

00:18:27.344 --> 00:18:30.948
Before the year's end,
I'm thinking of closing the ranch.

00:18:31.748 --> 00:18:34.051
Thank you for everything.

00:18:35.919 --> 00:18:38.322
This year? But it's almost New Year's!

00:18:39.556 --> 00:18:41.491
Breeding, training… I can't do it anymore.

00:18:42.426 --> 00:18:46.964
President, you've been so good to me.

00:18:48.265 --> 00:18:49.866
Do you have any health issues?

00:18:50.567 --> 00:18:51.935
It's not that, but…

00:18:52.636 --> 00:18:55.639
We don't have a successor,

00:18:56.773 --> 00:19:01.078
and I don't think we can fight
against the tide.

00:19:02.679 --> 00:19:03.513
I understand.

00:19:04.581 --> 00:19:06.183
Sorry for all the trouble.

00:19:06.683 --> 00:19:07.851
Not at all.

00:19:07.918 --> 00:19:10.687
Thank you for the memories.

00:19:12.022 --> 00:19:14.791
Leave Fight and Izana to me.

00:19:16.693 --> 00:19:19.863
Happiness, can you take her in too?

00:19:20.464 --> 00:19:21.965
I'll take care of her.

00:19:25.736 --> 00:19:26.770
Mr. Kurisu.

00:19:27.437 --> 00:19:28.572
You saved us.

00:19:28.639 --> 00:19:30.607
-Thank you.
-No…

00:19:32.876 --> 00:19:36.346
Can't you hold on a bit longer?

00:19:38.548 --> 00:19:40.484
Enough for one more win?

00:19:41.318 --> 00:19:43.287
That's the difficult part.

00:19:44.788 --> 00:19:48.425
I don't feel like we can win
against the Hokuryo horses.

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:55.499
Everyone wants a horse from Hokuryo Farm.

00:19:55.565 --> 00:19:59.136
A small Hidaka ranch asking
for 100 million yen in a private sale

00:19:59.202 --> 00:20:00.504
is practically a joke.

00:20:04.841 --> 00:20:05.909
Twelve point seven.

00:20:06.743 --> 00:20:07.778
Twelve point two.

00:20:08.345 --> 00:20:09.813
She's in great shape.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.983
Worth every penny.

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:15.085
The price is just a stepping stone.

00:20:18.021 --> 00:20:19.189
It's not enough.

00:20:20.624 --> 00:20:22.559
I want her to exceed my expectations.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.428
Contact the trainer.

00:20:25.495 --> 00:20:26.730
Understood.

00:20:29.066 --> 00:20:32.602
Your family also ran a ranch
in Hidaka, right?

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:35.372
It doesn't exist anymore, though.

00:20:36.006 --> 00:20:39.109
I wanted to save it, but I was too late.

00:20:39.176 --> 00:20:41.812
Just go home already!

00:20:41.878 --> 00:20:44.348
I just want to tag along for a while!

00:20:44.414 --> 00:20:45.282
Gosh!

00:20:45.349 --> 00:20:46.350
President.

00:20:47.351 --> 00:20:50.253
Actually, there's a horse
I would like you to see.

00:20:51.888 --> 00:20:55.559
So Mr. Nozaki bred them in America?

00:20:55.625 --> 00:21:00.063
He's a hardworking, determined man,
but few understand him.

00:21:00.764 --> 00:21:02.599
No, but 100 million…

00:21:03.467 --> 00:21:05.535
Why is he asking for such a high price?

00:21:06.403 --> 00:21:09.072
An unknown ranch
would never get a sale at this price.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.943
All we can do is take a look at the horse.

00:21:13.777 --> 00:21:15.011
I don't like him.

00:21:15.779 --> 00:21:16.747
Why?

00:21:17.247 --> 00:21:18.915
He doesn't understand business.

00:21:19.616 --> 00:21:23.019
"I bred it over in America, so buy it
for a higher cost," doesn't work.

00:21:23.086 --> 00:21:24.221
Private sales are about trust.

00:21:25.055 --> 00:21:27.724
If you don't plan to sell,
you shouldn't breed it!

00:21:27.791 --> 00:21:29.259
-But…
-Okay.

00:21:29.993 --> 00:21:31.128
Let's go to this farm.

00:21:31.194 --> 00:21:32.028
What?

00:21:32.095 --> 00:21:34.164
With uncooperative ranches like this,

00:21:34.231 --> 00:21:36.833
it's better to go there
and talk to them directly!

00:21:38.268 --> 00:21:41.872
Actually, it's my friend's farm,
so please be nice to them.

00:21:41.938 --> 00:21:43.006
Why should I care?

00:21:43.073 --> 00:21:44.374
-Let's go!
-Okay!

00:21:48.044 --> 00:21:50.213
Sorry for making you wait!

00:21:51.448 --> 00:21:54.684
Hey. Is that person really your friend?

00:21:54.751 --> 00:21:55.652
What?

00:21:56.219 --> 00:21:57.421
Your "friend"?

00:21:59.689 --> 00:22:00.524
Sorry.

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:03.827
Mr. Hironaka is going back
to Miho tonight, so it has to be now.

00:22:03.894 --> 00:22:05.295
-Sorry for the surprise visit.
-It's fine.

00:22:05.362 --> 00:22:06.196
Well then…

00:22:06.263 --> 00:22:08.265
Yes, show us the 100 million yen horse.

00:22:08.331 --> 00:22:09.433
Don't hold out on me!

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.269
-It's actually him.
-What?

00:22:12.335 --> 00:22:15.038
Oh, nothing! This way, please.

00:22:21.178 --> 00:22:24.181
Dad, this is the owner of the Royal…

00:22:24.247 --> 00:22:26.316
Hi. I am Kozo Sanno.

00:22:26.383 --> 00:22:27.684
A horse owner.

00:22:28.418 --> 00:22:31.888
My secretary insisted, so we dropped by.

00:22:35.492 --> 00:22:37.694
This is my friend from college…

00:22:37.761 --> 00:22:40.997
-It's been a while. I'm Kurisu.
-Skip the greetings. Show me the horse!

00:22:41.064 --> 00:22:42.466
Are you sure?

00:22:43.033 --> 00:22:44.067
What?

00:22:44.134 --> 00:22:45.969
Compared to Hokuryo horses,

00:22:46.036 --> 00:22:48.371
our pedigrees and environment
are very different.

00:22:48.438 --> 00:22:49.272
Dad.

00:22:49.339 --> 00:22:53.710
Perhaps Hokuryo
will have a better horse for you.

00:22:53.777 --> 00:22:54.911
Dad.

00:22:55.745 --> 00:22:59.716
Mr. Nozaki, we didn't come here
for no reason.

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:03.487
-Kanako recommended it to us.
-Quit the talk. Show me the horse.

00:23:03.553 --> 00:23:04.654
President.

00:23:05.856 --> 00:23:08.925
Do you truly have the will to win?

00:23:08.992 --> 00:23:10.594
-Cut it out, Dad!
-What?

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:12.696
I'm asking if you have the will to win.

00:23:12.762 --> 00:23:14.564
I'm sorry. I'll take you to the horse.

00:23:14.631 --> 00:23:16.633
How many years have you been doing this?

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.668
-Don't talk like an amateur!
-President.

00:23:18.735 --> 00:23:20.303
This isn't business.

00:23:21.004 --> 00:23:22.506
It's a fight.

00:23:22.572 --> 00:23:26.109
A fight where, to win, we stake our lives!

00:23:26.176 --> 00:23:28.678
Oh, wow, well said.

00:23:28.745 --> 00:23:32.682
I'm also fighting for the livelihoods
of hundreds of employees!

00:23:32.749 --> 00:23:34.918
We can't sell to someone
who doesn't intend to win!

00:23:34.985 --> 00:23:37.420
-Stop it!
-I said we won't sell!

00:23:37.487 --> 00:23:39.256
-Dad…
-Sir! We haven't seen the horse…

00:23:39.322 --> 00:23:42.058
-Should I lend you my hearing aid?
-President…

00:23:42.125 --> 00:23:45.028
-He'll have a cup of tea.
-Okay, sure.

00:23:45.095 --> 00:23:47.230
Is there no other place around?

00:23:47.964 --> 00:23:51.067
Everyone around here uses this place.

00:23:51.134 --> 00:23:52.102
You want some kelp?

00:23:52.168 --> 00:23:54.471
Oh, anything is fine. Bring it quickly!

00:23:56.239 --> 00:23:57.574
I am truly sorry.

00:23:57.641 --> 00:23:59.175
No, we are too.

00:24:01.444 --> 00:24:02.345
What are you doing?

00:24:02.412 --> 00:24:04.114
-Facebook.
-I see.

00:24:07.384 --> 00:24:10.554
Okay, here are your drinks. Thank you.

00:24:18.895 --> 00:24:22.632
I think he's too emotionally attached.
It makes him stubborn.

00:24:22.699 --> 00:24:24.267
Hello!

00:24:24.334 --> 00:24:26.269
Put the Fighters on.

00:24:26.336 --> 00:24:29.272
-They're not playing today.
-What? Seriously?

00:24:29.339 --> 00:24:31.541
That's so boring.

00:24:31.608 --> 00:24:33.076
What do you think?

00:24:35.011 --> 00:24:36.746
About your horses?

00:24:38.081 --> 00:24:39.516
You'll take over, right?

00:24:40.417 --> 00:24:42.919
Many ranches are closing
due to a lack of successors.

00:24:43.887 --> 00:24:47.257
But you have to live on
even after your father dies.

00:24:48.124 --> 00:24:50.026
Does your father understand that?

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.896
He doesn't understand.

00:24:53.964 --> 00:24:55.665
That old man knows nothing!

00:24:55.732 --> 00:24:58.335
-Hey!
-It's not about winning or losing.

00:24:58.401 --> 00:25:00.937
We're desperately trying to make a living!

00:25:01.004 --> 00:25:03.006
He doesn't understand any of that.

00:25:03.673 --> 00:25:05.542
I'm not asking you guys.

00:25:06.076 --> 00:25:07.510
I'm asking her.

00:25:07.577 --> 00:25:08.478
Oh, my!

00:25:08.545 --> 00:25:10.714
So scary.

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:15.018
I believe…

00:25:17.454 --> 00:25:19.322
my horse won't lose to anyone.

00:25:19.956 --> 00:25:21.257
There it is.

00:25:22.525 --> 00:25:24.060
I understand how you all feel.

00:25:24.928 --> 00:25:28.698
However, the ultimate goal
of a racehorse is to win.

00:25:28.765 --> 00:25:31.868
-To produce a horse that can win--
-How many ranches have you ruined?

00:25:34.137 --> 00:25:36.706
How many breeders have been
sweet-talked by your father,

00:25:37.574 --> 00:25:40.343
spent a fortune, then gone bankrupt?

00:25:42.612 --> 00:25:46.249
Before the year's end,
I'm thinking of closing the ranch.

00:25:47.384 --> 00:25:49.686
You can't afford to dream.

00:25:49.753 --> 00:25:53.289
As long as you live here,
you have to do what you must!

00:25:53.823 --> 00:25:56.960
Breed horses and sell them,
even if the price is low!

00:25:57.027 --> 00:25:59.129
That's how a respectable ranch is run!

00:25:59.195 --> 00:26:00.030
You mock us all.

00:26:00.597 --> 00:26:02.666
-We're not mocking--
-You are!

00:26:03.333 --> 00:26:05.135
You said, "Things can't go on like this."

00:26:05.201 --> 00:26:07.437
That's basically rejecting
our way of life!

00:26:07.504 --> 00:26:08.571
I apologize.

00:26:12.709 --> 00:26:16.079
What you said resonates with me.

00:26:16.646 --> 00:26:17.480
But…

00:26:18.181 --> 00:26:21.484
we are making this deal to win.

00:26:21.551 --> 00:26:22.619
Of course,

00:26:23.153 --> 00:26:27.223
I fully understand that every horse
carries the wishes of its carers'.

00:26:27.791 --> 00:26:29.793
But we…

00:26:31.194 --> 00:26:32.929
We want hope.

00:26:33.496 --> 00:26:35.865
Hope that we can win.

00:26:36.633 --> 00:26:38.568
We are looking for such a horse.

00:26:38.635 --> 00:26:41.104
We want to meet such a breeder.

00:26:41.738 --> 00:26:43.506
"Hidaka ranches are no good."

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.810
"Only Hokuryo is good."
We absolutely don't believe that.

00:26:48.912 --> 00:26:51.948
You come from the city and demand hope?

00:26:53.349 --> 00:26:55.085
It's easy for you to say, you know?

00:26:56.252 --> 00:26:58.722
Easy for you to say.

00:27:18.575 --> 00:27:20.276
Now, in Hidaka,

00:27:20.343 --> 00:27:23.780
there are many ranches
that are ignored in auctions.

00:27:24.347 --> 00:27:27.150
Few people remember the good times.

00:27:27.951 --> 00:27:30.019
It's tough to know that times were better.

00:27:30.086 --> 00:27:32.055
But it's also tough not knowing.

00:27:36.159 --> 00:27:38.094
-I'll take her home.
-Okay.

00:27:38.161 --> 00:27:42.766
Mr. Sanno, I'm truly sorry
we couldn't show you the horse.

00:27:44.067 --> 00:27:45.001
No worries.

00:27:45.502 --> 00:27:46.770
See you.

00:27:48.037 --> 00:27:48.872
Let's go.

00:27:49.472 --> 00:27:50.573
Okay.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.941
Keep fighting.

00:27:54.244 --> 00:27:57.480
You are the ones
who will make the horses stronger.

00:28:08.958 --> 00:28:12.061
I got married six months
after breaking up with you.

00:28:14.931 --> 00:28:17.167
Things like that really do happen.

00:28:22.939 --> 00:28:24.974
After marrying and having a child,

00:28:25.542 --> 00:28:28.611
my way of thinking gradually changed.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:35.418
Before,
I never intended to take over the farm,

00:28:36.586 --> 00:28:38.188
even though I loved it.

00:28:42.725 --> 00:28:47.831
Did your husband disagree
with you taking over the farm?

00:28:49.799 --> 00:28:51.134
For a while,

00:28:51.801 --> 00:28:54.337
we tried living in two locations,
Tokyo and here.

00:28:54.838 --> 00:29:00.343
But I just felt like it would be better
for Shohei to live here.

00:29:01.845 --> 00:29:04.747
So we talked about it seriously,

00:29:05.849 --> 00:29:07.250
but it didn't work out.

00:29:07.317 --> 00:29:10.353
It was an amicable divorce.

00:29:11.654 --> 00:29:13.790
And then I came back here.

00:29:19.596 --> 00:29:21.397
But I was so scared.

00:29:22.265 --> 00:29:25.068
Scared that I might ruin my child's life.

00:29:26.202 --> 00:29:27.303
I was so scared,

00:29:29.305 --> 00:29:31.374
I tried to forget it by working.

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:34.677
And yet…

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:38.781
This is frustrating.

00:29:47.423 --> 00:29:49.959
-Well, thank you.
-Sure.

00:29:53.496 --> 00:29:54.664
Mr. Hayashida…

00:29:56.466 --> 00:29:57.800
He's closing his ranch.

00:29:58.635 --> 00:29:59.736
What?

00:30:02.205 --> 00:30:04.807
It was my first time witnessing it.

00:30:05.742 --> 00:30:06.910
It was anticlimactic.

00:30:08.344 --> 00:30:09.512
Mr. Hayashida too?

00:30:11.981 --> 00:30:16.552
Of course, a horse won't run forever,

00:30:17.387 --> 00:30:19.255
people get old,

00:30:20.823 --> 00:30:22.992
and separation can come suddenly.

00:30:24.327 --> 00:30:28.498
But still,
I can't just say goodbye that easily.

00:30:30.033 --> 00:30:34.070
By sticking together,
maybe we can find a new dream, right?

00:30:35.271 --> 00:30:36.739
Even if it's tough now,

00:30:37.573 --> 00:30:40.710
you won't get there unless you continue.

00:30:41.911 --> 00:30:42.745
Yes.

00:30:44.147 --> 00:30:45.048
So…

00:30:48.151 --> 00:30:49.986
let me think about it with you.

00:30:51.087 --> 00:30:54.090
About the farm and about the horse.

00:30:59.629 --> 00:31:00.596
Let's think about them.

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:02.231
Together.

00:31:08.738 --> 00:31:09.973
Oh, Shohei.

00:31:10.873 --> 00:31:11.708
What are you doing?

00:31:12.275 --> 00:31:14.210
Nothing. You weren't coming in…

00:31:15.812 --> 00:31:17.246
Good evening.

00:31:17.313 --> 00:31:18.748
Oh, Shohei.

00:31:22.285 --> 00:31:23.386
Well…

00:31:24.187 --> 00:31:25.922
-See you.
-Yeah.

00:31:35.064 --> 00:31:36.399
Happiness?

00:31:36.466 --> 00:31:38.067
I thought about it all night.

00:31:38.735 --> 00:31:43.006
Can we move Happiness
from Mr. Hayashida to the Nozaki Farm?

00:31:44.574 --> 00:31:46.576
Happiness is a broodmare.

00:31:47.143 --> 00:31:50.780
Boarding a broodmare
requires us to pay a boarding fee.

00:31:51.347 --> 00:31:53.249
If we're going to pay anyway,

00:31:53.316 --> 00:31:57.587
then let's hire Nozaki Farm
to help them out.

00:31:57.653 --> 00:32:00.523
Why would we want to help that farm?

00:32:03.059 --> 00:32:04.794
You said it yourself.

00:32:05.795 --> 00:32:07.697
"You are the ones
who will make the horses stronger."

00:32:10.466 --> 00:32:12.802
Well, we need time for that.

00:32:13.436 --> 00:32:15.638
Time to keep the farm going.

00:32:16.272 --> 00:32:18.574
And by doing this,

00:32:18.641 --> 00:32:21.944
we will have a chance
to meet a strong horse.

00:32:22.945 --> 00:32:24.280
That's poor logic.

00:32:26.949 --> 00:32:30.753
But it would be a shame
to waste a successor.

00:32:32.121 --> 00:32:33.956
We're not helping that geezer.

00:32:34.023 --> 00:32:35.591
We're betting on the young.

00:32:36.859 --> 00:32:38.928
Make that clear.

00:32:40.997 --> 00:32:42.131
Understood.

00:32:45.968 --> 00:32:48.404
We've already arrived at the paddock area.

00:32:49.072 --> 00:32:52.075
No, we should be the ones apologizing
for coming so suddenly.

00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:56.879
Well, we're around the dead end
straight ahead from the entrance.

00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:59.415
Yes, that's right.

00:33:01.217 --> 00:33:03.853
We'll be waiting here.

00:33:14.964 --> 00:33:16.232
Hey.

00:34:08.317 --> 00:34:09.452
No way.

00:34:10.353 --> 00:34:12.054
It took a liking to him.

00:34:14.991 --> 00:34:16.692
That shy horse…

00:34:31.274 --> 00:34:33.209
Are you sure you want to hire us?

00:34:40.216 --> 00:34:41.050
Yes.

00:34:41.651 --> 00:34:44.587
Please take care of Royal Happiness.

00:34:45.221 --> 00:34:48.424
Please help her produce a healthy foal.

00:34:50.293 --> 00:34:51.394
Thank you very much.

00:34:52.495 --> 00:34:54.630
Hey. Do you have a glass?

00:34:55.431 --> 00:34:56.465
A cup is fine too.

00:34:57.533 --> 00:34:58.968
I suddenly want a drink.

00:35:00.002 --> 00:35:00.836
Gosh.

00:35:01.504 --> 00:35:03.940
Sake in the morning is the best, isn't it?

00:35:06.909 --> 00:35:09.845
By the way, what's with that horse?

00:35:11.047 --> 00:35:14.850
He's a little thin,
but calm and dignified.

00:35:16.285 --> 00:35:19.755
You could confidently sell him.
Why be so stubborn?

00:35:20.656 --> 00:35:22.992
I am confident.

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:28.030
If I weren't, I wouldn't have put
a price of 100 million.

00:35:31.234 --> 00:35:32.802
I don't get it.

00:35:33.402 --> 00:35:38.641
You're always so demanding of others,
but don't want to talk about yourself.

00:35:41.377 --> 00:35:42.712
That's not fair.

00:35:43.679 --> 00:35:46.048
Talk to us. That's what business is.

00:35:47.717 --> 00:35:50.786
Thanks for the drink.

00:35:58.060 --> 00:35:59.228
In the past,

00:36:00.363 --> 00:36:02.765
thoroughbreds meant Hidaka.

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:05.968
But now it's tough.

00:36:07.036 --> 00:36:09.005
Hokuryo Farm dominates.

00:36:10.106 --> 00:36:13.342
The people in Hidaka have given up.

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:16.612
We're just surviving now.

00:36:17.813 --> 00:36:19.348
But I want to win.

00:36:20.383 --> 00:36:21.684
I want to win.

00:36:23.619 --> 00:36:27.857
Otherwise, I don't know
what I even live for.

00:36:29.592 --> 00:36:31.394
It's the same for the horses.

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:35.965
What were they born for,
and what will they die for?

00:36:38.267 --> 00:36:42.605
That's why I decided to take a gamble
that Hokuryo wouldn't.

00:36:44.206 --> 00:36:47.510
You went all the way
to America for breeding?

00:36:49.011 --> 00:36:51.814
Everyone around me called me a fool.

00:36:53.249 --> 00:36:56.819
"No one is looking
for that kind of bloodline anymore."

00:36:57.386 --> 00:36:58.954
They called me a gambler.

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:02.391
But I am serious.

00:37:03.793 --> 00:37:05.194
I will win with that horse.

00:37:05.995 --> 00:37:09.699
My goal, no matter what anyone says,

00:37:09.765 --> 00:37:12.635
is to win a G1
with a horse from this farm.

00:37:13.703 --> 00:37:18.741
To stand at the pinnacle of over
8,000 thoroughbreds born each year.

00:37:21.243 --> 00:37:23.379
I want to win
the nation's top Grade I race

00:37:23.446 --> 00:37:25.681
and make our horse the best in Japan.

00:37:25.748 --> 00:37:27.083
At the Arima Kinen.

00:37:29.819 --> 00:37:32.688
I appreciate the boarding contract.

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:35.825
I can also tell that you,

00:37:36.525 --> 00:37:39.528
as my daughter's friend,
are trying to help us.

00:37:39.595 --> 00:37:40.863
Thank you.

00:37:41.731 --> 00:37:42.798
However,

00:37:44.033 --> 00:37:46.802
regarding that horse, I don't need pity.

00:37:48.003 --> 00:37:49.405
I just really want

00:37:50.206 --> 00:37:53.142
to sell him to someone
truly determined to win.

00:37:53.843 --> 00:37:54.944
That's all.

00:37:56.011 --> 00:37:57.546
It's not that I don't want to sell.

00:37:58.314 --> 00:38:02.651
The 100 million is a price
I set to test that resolve.

00:38:05.154 --> 00:38:06.655
Who do you think you are?

00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:11.527
You make it sound like we,
horse owners, don't want to win.

00:38:13.963 --> 00:38:14.964
Resolve?

00:38:16.732 --> 00:38:18.267
Stop insulting us!

00:38:24.173 --> 00:38:28.677
Why are you so convinced
that only you want to win?

00:38:29.912 --> 00:38:31.881
What does winning mean to you?

00:38:40.689 --> 00:38:41.757
My father stands for…

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:45.795
his fellow farm owners,

00:38:47.963 --> 00:38:49.999
who grew up and worked alongside him.

00:38:50.065 --> 00:38:53.202
Their emotions make him carry on.

00:38:54.703 --> 00:38:56.272
Many tried their best,

00:38:57.306 --> 00:39:01.577
yet had to close down
or died with their dreams unfulfilled.

00:39:02.445 --> 00:39:04.780
We carry on the dream of those people.

00:39:10.553 --> 00:39:12.388
My mother was one of them.

00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:15.891
My father's dream

00:39:17.693 --> 00:39:21.730
is the dream of everyone in Hidaka.

00:39:31.373 --> 00:39:32.641
Dream, huh?

00:39:34.643 --> 00:39:37.546
Sorry, but my dream is also the G1.

00:39:38.981 --> 00:39:40.716
To take first place at Arima.

00:39:42.318 --> 00:39:43.452
How about that?

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:47.556
Someone who shares your dream is here.

00:39:51.026 --> 00:39:52.127
And now,

00:39:53.662 --> 00:39:54.997
I have one more dream.

00:39:57.266 --> 00:40:01.270
To achieve that win with a Hidaka horse.

00:40:04.974 --> 00:40:09.345
If I win with a Hokuryo horse,
no one will be surprised.

00:40:09.945 --> 00:40:11.347
I will have bought that win.

00:40:12.014 --> 00:40:14.250
They'll just say, "Of course, he won."

00:40:17.653 --> 00:40:20.089
That's not what I'm aiming for.

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:23.826
If people aren't shocked, it's no fun.

00:40:23.893 --> 00:40:25.694
"I don't care about horse races."

00:40:26.328 --> 00:40:27.897
"I don't know about horses."

00:40:28.497 --> 00:40:31.433
People like that will say,
"What is this horse?"

00:40:32.434 --> 00:40:35.571
I'll bring such a horse
to the race and win.

00:40:39.074 --> 00:40:40.342
I'll win the G1.

00:40:42.144 --> 00:40:45.180
For that, I need a Hidaka horse.

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:53.622
Let me join your dream.

00:41:04.533 --> 00:41:06.235
Do you have the will to win?

00:41:09.939 --> 00:41:11.307
It's all I want.

00:41:12.741 --> 00:41:14.577
Then please, I beg you!

00:41:26.188 --> 00:41:29.091
All right, let's toast!
A celebratory toast!

00:41:29.825 --> 00:41:32.261
We're all drunk with ambition!
In the same boat!

00:41:33.262 --> 00:41:34.763
-Yes!
-Yes.

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:36.165
Good answer.

00:41:37.666 --> 00:41:38.667
Cheers.

00:41:39.234 --> 00:41:40.736
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

00:42:04.026 --> 00:42:07.262
I wonder if Mr. Hironaka will like it.

00:42:08.464 --> 00:42:10.265
Even if he doesn't like it,

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:13.035
I'm betting on this horse.

00:42:14.269 --> 00:42:15.738
The horse is the main star.

00:42:16.338 --> 00:42:17.373
Yes.

00:42:19.642 --> 00:42:20.643
Kurisu.

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:22.978
You name it.

00:42:23.946 --> 00:42:26.215
What? Me?

00:42:27.449 --> 00:42:29.318
You brought everyone together.

00:42:29.852 --> 00:42:30.953
Take responsibility.

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:32.721
What?

00:42:36.058 --> 00:42:38.193
How about "Thunder"?

00:42:39.662 --> 00:42:41.296
-Thunder?
-I mean, come on.

00:42:46.368 --> 00:42:47.503
Royal Thunder.

00:42:48.971 --> 00:42:50.406
Thunder, huh?

00:42:51.407 --> 00:42:53.342
Thank you for reaching this decision.

00:42:53.976 --> 00:42:55.444
"Reaching"?

00:42:58.647 --> 00:43:00.916
I made my decision
the moment I saw this farm.

00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:02.384
What?

00:43:02.451 --> 00:43:06.088
Have you looked at the grass
in this paddock?

00:43:06.689 --> 00:43:08.791
The tips of the grass are properly mowed.

00:43:08.857 --> 00:43:10.926
For the horses' sake, this is essential.

00:43:11.593 --> 00:43:15.230
But many ranches skip it
because they don't have enough manpower.

00:43:18.467 --> 00:43:20.069
But this place…

00:43:20.636 --> 00:43:25.074
Despite having only two people,
they managed it perfectly.

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:30.112
That makes them trustworthy.

00:43:33.115 --> 00:43:34.149
I told you.

00:43:35.317 --> 00:43:36.652
About horses, I don't know…

00:43:36.719 --> 00:43:39.088
You don't know much. Even so…

00:43:39.755 --> 00:43:41.023
That was the deciding factor?

00:43:42.691 --> 00:43:44.393
Who do you think I am?

00:43:45.627 --> 00:43:46.462
Oh, right.

00:43:46.962 --> 00:43:47.796
That woman…

00:43:48.464 --> 00:43:49.498
She's your ex, right?

00:43:51.967 --> 00:43:53.368
What? Are you stupid?

00:43:55.170 --> 00:43:56.505
You're single, right?

00:43:57.906 --> 00:43:59.308
Hold her hand, at least.

00:44:00.008 --> 00:44:01.910
Did you hold hands last night?

00:44:01.977 --> 00:44:04.413
We didn't! Are you stupid?

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:07.549
You just called me stupid twice,
you bastard!

00:44:20.796 --> 00:44:21.964
-Mr. Kurisu.
-Yes?

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:24.199
-The president is asking for you.
-Okay.

00:44:31.507 --> 00:44:33.175
Royal Hope.

00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:36.578
What? Wait, what?

00:44:37.546 --> 00:44:38.614
Not bad, right?

00:44:43.252 --> 00:44:44.219
Yes.

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:47.790
I was looking for a horse
with a name like that.

00:44:51.693 --> 00:44:54.263
And so they finally met

00:44:54.897 --> 00:44:59.368
a great hope
that will turn the wheels of fate.

00:45:01.136 --> 00:45:02.271
Hope?

00:45:03.572 --> 00:45:04.773
Hope, huh?

00:45:05.507 --> 00:45:07.109
It's good.

00:45:07.176 --> 00:45:09.044
It's really good.

00:45:16.985 --> 00:45:19.021
MY DREAM FOR THE FUTURE
JOCKEY - SHOHEI NOZAKI

00:45:23.826 --> 00:45:26.295
Shohei? Are you back?

00:45:26.895 --> 00:45:27.729
Yes, I'm home!

00:45:29.565 --> 00:45:33.502
The race continues
until the legacy is passed on.

00:45:34.002 --> 00:45:35.804
Would you ride our Royal Hope?

00:45:35.871 --> 00:45:37.539
-You're arrogant.
-Can you convince him?

00:45:37.606 --> 00:45:40.309
"Kozo Sanno appoints troublemaker,
Ryujiro Saki."

00:45:40.375 --> 00:45:42.444
Would you consider transferring
to the national circuit?

00:45:42.511 --> 00:45:44.680
Not everyone can be
lured by the national circuit.

00:45:44.746 --> 00:45:46.415
I have no choice but to bet on you two.

00:45:46.481 --> 00:45:48.550
"Before I knew it, I was running."

00:45:48.617 --> 00:45:50.052
