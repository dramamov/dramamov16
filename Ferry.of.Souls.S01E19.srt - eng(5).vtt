00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.680
So what do we do next?

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.600
Infiltrate their ranks.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.600
How?

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:48.280
Aren't you the cautious one

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.400
who thinks of everything?

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.860
Think of something quick.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.080
Let me put my brilliant mind to work.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.479
Let me think...

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.480
Maybe I could apply to be a cook.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.400
My culinary skills are exceptional after all.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.930
Can't you be more original?

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.180
We're not making a cooking show here.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.280
You think of something.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.080
Let me know when you have an idea.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.720
Hey! What are you doing?

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.250
You've dirtied my clothes!

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.130
What's the meaning of this?

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.800
Help!

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.400
Help! Someone's beating me!

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.060
Innkeeper!

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.000
Feiye!

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:34.540
Stop hitting me, husband!

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.360
You'll beat me to death!

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.760
What's happening?

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.360
Help me!

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.760
My husband is trying to kill me!

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.160
Feiye!

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.570
Ouch!

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.680
Alright, alright, take it easy.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.340
Wait, wait.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.240
Li Wubai.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.920
Now both human and demon realms are in chaos.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.160
You, a grown man,

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.560
not only refuse to serve your country,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.320
but only know how to bully women at home.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.650
What kind of man are you?

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.640
Hey, wait!

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.280
Hey, Feiye!

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.340
If you speak again,

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.120
I'll cut out your tongue.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.660
Sister,

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.800
where are you all going?

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.000
Could you spare my life

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.329
and take me with you?

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.320
We're on a mission

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.640
and it's really not convenient.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.240
Please, I'm begging you.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.640
If I go back with him, he'll beat me to death.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.800
Xiao Liu,

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.720
we came out here

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.650
to do something important.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.440
That's right.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.040
Taking in such a burden,

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.660
what's that about?

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.680
Please.

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:57.520
Fine.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.690
Get up first.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.360
You can ride in my carriage.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.890
But you can't leave my side.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.260
We're on a mission,

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.260
and you can't move around freely.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.500
Thank you, sister.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.400
Yiyi,

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.530
what should we do with this man?

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.330
Tie him up

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.320
and throw him in the carriage too.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.800
Out here in the wilderness,

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.320
he might get eaten by wolves.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.980
Find a suitable place up ahead

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.060
to drop him off.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.050
Sister, you have no idea

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.460
I thought getting married

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.320
would give me lifelong support.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.860
But unexpectedly,

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.520
that's when the good days came to an end.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.530
Don't worry.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.620
Take your time.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.960
This scoundrel

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.410
is an expert at drinking, gambling, and womanizing.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.440
Whenever he's broke, he comes home to clean me out.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.360
I'm just a woman,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.460
how could I have enough money to support him?

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.640
And now,

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.380
he beats me whenever he runs out of money.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.680
You're such a good actor,

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.680
you should join Mei Jiulang's theater troupe.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.640
My mother-in-law is no better.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
I have to wait on her every day

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.060
and she constantly makes me stand at attention.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.530
Because I haven't given birth to a boy,

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.200
I've endured countless cold shoulders.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.280
Why didn't you leave him earlier?

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.400
I wanted to!

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.600
That's why I ran away.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.760
But I keep getting dragged back,

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.960
and the beatings get worse every time they catch me.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:20.600
Wu Hu.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.530
You're way too timid

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.800
and unworthy of being one of the Four Masters.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.860
Our job is already living on the edge,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.120
yet you're afraid of ghosts?

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.600
This money isn't for wandering spirits.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.880
This place is dangerous.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.680
If I die in this foreign land,

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.720
I doubt anyone will pay tribute to me next year.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.159
So,

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.200
I'm leaving something for myself to remember.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.159
Hahaha!

00:06:58.159 --> 00:06:59.240
What's all this noise?

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.370
I'm trying to sleep.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.020
Shut up, all of you.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.970
If I hear such talk again...

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.160
Get out now.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:08.770
Mr. Chen,

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.240
we need to get going.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.040
Forget it.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.700
Did I say something wrong?

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.160
In this business, we follow certain rules.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.080
Don't wash your face,

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:18.940
be able to cook,

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.080
be good at weaving mats,

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.010
and avoid women.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.210
The first three rules are fine.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.400
But now we're taking in this woman on our cart.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.460
What's that about?

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.480
It's damn bad luck.

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:32.820
Chen Jiang.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.520
You're beating around the bush.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.570
If you think I'm not fit to lead you,

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.200
then fight me.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.760
If you win,

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:41.960
I, Liu Yiyi,

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.970
will be at your command.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.210
Liu Yiyi,

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.260
let me tell you,

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.280
you're being too soft-hearted.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.320
Keeping these two useless people...

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.380
They'll drag us down sooner or later.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:36.600
Chen.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.159
Stop it.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.520
Among the four of us, whether it's fighting skills

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.250
or strategy,

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.760
none of us can match Yiyi.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.560
Delivering the tribute is crucial.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.090
We can't afford any more internal conflicts.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.410
Is Yiyi alright?

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.020
Don't take Chen's words to heart.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.440
He's just a rough man.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.690
This Chen Jiang may seem tough.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.840
In fact, he's just a reckless, brainless fool.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.120
As for this Li Wubai,

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.130
According to what you said,

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.730
he must be the one hiding the deepest secrets.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.460
He's Liu Yiyi's lover,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.640
using her trust to frame her.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.140
We must be on guard.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.560
To be honest,

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:36.960
I don't want Liu Yiyi

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.480
to suffer through that painful experience again.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.560
But our purpose this time

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.220
is to uncover the whole truth.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.880
We can only observe for now,

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.120
act when the time is right,

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.120
and not interfere with the outcome.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.860
Then we can only take it one step at a time.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.760
Shangguan Feiye, I'm warning you,

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.360
stop slandering my reputation.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.840
All that talk about me being heartless and abusive,

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.370
stop labeling me like that.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.120
That depends on your behavior.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.760
After all, I now have Liu Yiyi

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.020
as my powerful backer.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.080
She's not here now.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.410
You'd better watch out.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:16.730
You're back.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:18.920
Miss,

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.200
you're awake.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:21.760
You heartless man,

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.890
you're still alive?

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.200
Thanks to your blessing.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.800
I'm still barely surviving.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.120
Miss.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.640
Just call me Feiye.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.360
Thank you for taking me in yesterday.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.820
I don't know your name yet.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:38.920
I am Liu Yiyi.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:40.760
Yiyi.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.730
Sister Yiyi.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.920
How much longer until we arrive?

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.400
My bones

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.160
are about to fall apart from all this bumping.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.440
Just hold on for two more days.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.320
We've already reached Hulu Ridge.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.400
Another 10 miles west is Mijin Pass.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:55.800
Once we get there,

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.730
we'll be close to our destination.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:59.640
However,

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.040
I'm a wanderer

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.680
with no fixed abode.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.260
After I deliver the goods,

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.570
After I complete the delivery,

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.160
I'll be heading far away.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.290
Following me isn't a good plan for you.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.970
What are your plans for the future?

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.170
What did you just say

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.280
about Mijin Port?

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.220
Oh no, I'm done for!

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.160
Mijin Port is my wife's hometown.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:22.890
If I go there,

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.490
I'll be beaten to death!

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.040
Right.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.480
Once we get there, I can find my way home.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:30.480
For these few days,

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.140
I'll have to trouble you to take care of me, Yiyi.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:33.890
However,

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.480
from what that gentleman just said,

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.290
it seems we've caused you quite some trouble.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.120
It's fine.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.560
Don't worry about it.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.620
I'm in charge here.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.160
Besides, we're just making a delivery.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.560
One more person won't make any difference.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.580
What's wrong with you?

00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:58.890
Are you okay?

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.140
None of your business.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:03.880
Yiyi,

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.570
are you feeling unwell?

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.640
It's nothing.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.760
Probably just not used to

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.000
being away from home.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.040
But forcing yourself like this isn't good.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.500
The journey isn't urgent.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.420
You'd better rest for a while.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.960
Ouch!

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:23.560
Ow!

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.240
My butt hurts so much!

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.890
Oh, we've been walking for so long.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:29.800
Miss,

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.760
can we stop for a moment?

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.160
I need to relieve myself.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:36.820
Stop the carriage.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.170
Set up camp here.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.890
We'll continue our journey tomorrow.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.120
I told you

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.690
traveling with women is such a hassle.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:10.580
Enough.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.120
We've been traveling for so long.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.180
Everyone is tired,

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.780
we should take a break.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:21.450
Yiyi.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.730
How are you feeling?

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.040
Is your illness acting up again?

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:35.600
Wubai,

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.520
please give me some more medicine.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:37.880
No.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.760
Taking medicine so frequently

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.420
will be too much for your body.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.680
This is not the place to talk.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.930
Meet me by the river after dark.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.080
What?

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.920
Didn't I tell you to wait for me here?

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:48.980
What are you doing?

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:49.840
Darling.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.600
I understand what you mean.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.400
Let's make up.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.720
Are you crazy?

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.170
There's someone behind us.

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.380
What were you about to say?

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.130
I was saying that

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.680
Liu Yiyi wasn't having an attack.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:26.680
She was poisoned.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.240
Poisoned?

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.600
There's a wound on the back of her neck

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.800
caused by a Southern Red Spider needle.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.060
It's normally a slow-acting poison,

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.440
but if the poisoned person happens to fight with someone,

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.320
their heart rhythm becomes chaotic

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.650
and the poison takes effect immediately.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.400
Chen Jiang must have poisoned her.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.860
He first provoked Liu Yiyi

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.660
and then seized the chance to poison her.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.800
But Chen Jiang isn't a meticulous planner.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.330
Someone must be behind him.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.250
Could it be Li Wubai?

00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.660
If it really is him,

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:01.980
Liu Yiyi is truly pitiful,

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.780
betrayed by the person she loves.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:09.840
In that case,

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.570
you two make quite a good match.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.600
Li Wubai plotted against Liu Yiyi,

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.060
and I...

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.560
Let's not waste time here.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.440
We need to hurry back.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.370
Who knows how Liu Yiyi is doing now.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.400
Just tell me, do you still have feelings for her?
