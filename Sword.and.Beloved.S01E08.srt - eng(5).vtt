[Sword and Beloved]

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.400
[Episode 8]

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.510
A sword that's meant to slay demons

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.000
has somehow grown warm.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.030
Wangquan Fugui has actually

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.190
fallen for a petty little demon.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.430
Feelings make people weak.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.030
Is my clone in the circle ready?

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.800
It's ready at any time.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.280
Lady Feng?

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.170
Don't look at me like that.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.560
Do you know

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.150
my senior will be in trouble
if you stay here?

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.350
You have two choices:

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.680
die

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.400
by my sword,

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:57.140
or leave right now!

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.000
I'm dying anyway.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.080
But there's still

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.710
one last thing I need to do.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.360
I can't leave here yet.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.010
What do you mean?

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.880
Lady Feng,

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.079
have you been to
the Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai?

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.000
Why are you asking that?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.750
Just answer me.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.480
Cut the crap!

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.750
I tried to get the antidote
from Madam Yin,

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:27.310
so

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.440
I took the Gu poison myself too.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.680
I don't buy it.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.790
You used such a foolish way
to get the antidote?

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.680
I'm just

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.030
a lowly spider demon.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.360
I couldn't think of a better way.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.030
But…

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.280
but I've done

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:47.680
all I could.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.200
I have no regrets now.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.800
Her spiritual power is heavily depleted,

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.170
but the poison in her body
is clearly gone.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.720
Let me see how long you little spider
can keep pretending.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.310
Lady Feng,

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.120
how much longer…

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.400
how much longer do I have left?

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.920
At most,

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.950
three days.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.240
Three days?

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.390
So soon.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.000
Looks like…

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.409
looks like I can't finish my embroidery.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.480
Lady Feng,

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.510
have you ever been to
the Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai?

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.040
Can you take me there,

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.720
Lady Feng?

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.159
Let go!

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.720
Why ask that?

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.090
Because Young Master Fugui

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.560
always wants to know

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.090
what that place looks like.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.360
Before I die,

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.690
I want to embroider that place for him.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.390
If you take me there,

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.750
I can finish it sooner.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.720
Aren't you afraid

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.880
I'll drop you mid-flight

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.410
and shatter you to pieces?

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:08.920
You won't.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.160
You may be strict,

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.560
but you have a soft heart.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:15.310
Lady Feng,

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.750
please, just once, take me there,

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:18.480
will you?

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.190
You've been cured of the poison.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.310
Liar!

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.760
Don't try to look all pitiful before me.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.720
Humans and demons walk different paths.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.750
If you keep staying here,

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.240
you'll only bring my senior trouble.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.950
I'll report you to Master!

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:34.120
Lady Feng.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.310
Lady Feng!

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.980
The poison in me

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:44.480
has been neutralized?

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.430
This is all
just that little spider's ploy.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.159
Feng Tingyun, don't be fooled.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:54.510
She's a demon.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:55.800
Once she's dead,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.330
Senior Fugui will come back to his senses.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:00.680
But

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.050
he's lived so lonely all his life.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.290
Only lately has he begun to look happy.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.040
Do I really…

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.360
have to do this?

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.720
Master.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:19.000
Tingyun?

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.200
Why are you here?

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.480
You want to see me?

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.310
Master.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.840
Is something troubling you?

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.510
Why are you hesitating?

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.950
That's not like you at all.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.170
You know you can tell me anything.

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.680
Tingyun,

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.190
you want to see me?

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:10.990
Senior Fugui,

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.690
do you remember the first time we met?

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.160
I was nine.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.000
My village was slaughtered by demons.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:23.720
You saved me.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:28.590
Of course I remember.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.140
You rushed into the Palanquin

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.510
the moment it landed,

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:35.510
all covered in blood.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.570
I was ridiculous, wasn't I?

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:41.750
No.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.159
Not ridiculous at all.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.450
You clearly told me where the demons were.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:49.520
You were very brave.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.360
Only you would think that way.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.390
I think I fell for you right then.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.490
I followed you every day in secret,

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:06.370
just to watch you practice your sword

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.050
and to copy your handwriting.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.240
I dreamed that one day

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:12.720
I'd be as strong as you

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.360
and fight by your side.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:22.750
Senior Fugui,

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:24.430
I know

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.510
you don't like me.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:29.000
But what I don't understand is…

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.430
why her?

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.600
Why that frail spider demon?

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:41.120
Tingyun,

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:43.240
it's not what you think.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.720
Every life in this world deserves respect.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:48.720
I just…

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.570
didn't want her to be killed like that.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.070
That's not it.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.600
If it were really just about saving her,

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.750
if it were only sympathy,

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:01.720
then why didn't you

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.630
ever feel the same for me?

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:06.130
If I hadn't felt sympathy for you,

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.960
would you even be here now?

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.800
Senior Fugui,

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:23.790
I just want to know one thing today.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.270
Do you…

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:30.270
like her?

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:39.310
Senior Fugui,

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.000
a demon

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.260
will always be a demon.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.510
Humans and demons walk different paths.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:47.240
Moreover, you're the Soldier.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.330
There's no future between you and her.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:57.550
I'll handle it

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.080
in my own way.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:01.510
I'm leaving.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.160
Senior Fugui.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.030
Why aren't you ever afraid

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.010
I'll go tattling to Master?

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.140
Because you're Feng Tingyun.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.640
Your sword essence is

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.750
free as the wind

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.060
and graceful as drifting clouds.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.000
Master,

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:54.000
I like someone.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.840
But he doesn't like me back.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.000
Then, Tingyun,

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.200
how do you plan to handle it?

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:02.790
Let go,

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:04.270
or

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:06.670
keep chasing him?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:10.630
Yeah.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.610
Whether Senior Fugui likes me or not,

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.480
I am Feng Tingyun,

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.550
Swordswoman Feng Tingyun.

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:21.910
I walk

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:24.390
my own path.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:49.680
Young Master Fugui,

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:52.480
I have a question for you.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.670
Go ahead.

00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:59.390
You never took the antidote.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.440
You gave it to me.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:02.600
Right?

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.150
Yes.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.350
Then what about your poison?

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.250
The poison in my body

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:10.360
has already been neutralized.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.390
You solved the problem yourself

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:19.720
and saved your brother.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:20.800
Qingtong,

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.980
your efforts weren't in vain.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:29.210
Then, Young Master Fugui,

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:31.000
shouldn't you

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.510
reward me with some candy?

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.620
I don't have any candy.

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:55.880
Young Master Fugui!

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.450
Young Master Fugui,

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.030
I like everything

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:03.870
you've done for me.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:06.390
I'll forever remember

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:08.670
your kindness to me.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.240
I will never forget it.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.550
Master Quan,

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.030
long time no see.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.690
How does it feel
to fail at the finish line?

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.620
It's all the Soldier's fault.

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:48.630
Can Madam

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.000
help me obtain the Dragon Spine Sword

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.330
to wash away this shame?

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:55.150
I want the entire Yiqi Alliance

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:56.910
to kneel before me.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.720
There is a way,

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.270
of course.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.000
But once you have the Dragon Spine Sword,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.240
what will you do with it?

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.320
I'll make Wangquan Hongye and his son

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:11.670
pay the price.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.080
But what Madam wants
is for Wangquan Fugui

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.960
to be reviled by the world!

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:18.080

Master.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.780
Why did you go to Silk Cave
without approval?

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:41.970
Why didn't you slay the demons there?

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.120
Uncle,

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.660
Cousin took down Madam Yin

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.050
without shedding blood

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:53.650
or harming innocents.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:54.960
That's fine.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:58.400
Given how powerful you are,

wiping out the lesser demons in Silk Cave

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:03.160
would've been easy.

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:06.640
Why did you do something unnecessary?

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.490
It's said in the Demon Realm

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:12.750
that the Soldier tried to win over
the demons in Silk Cave.

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:13.630
Are you crazy?

-that's…
-I'm asking him!

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:24.530
There were countless demons in Silk Cave

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.440
struggling to survive under Madam Yin.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.150
Most of them haven't done anything evil.

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:30.870
Their lives

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.970
shouldn't be taken.

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:34.600
Nonsense!

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.910
You're willing to damage your reputation
as the Soldier

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:39.480
just to protect those demons?

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.200
There are good and evil demons.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.930
They have the right to live too.

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:44.400
Even as the Soldier,

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:46.330
I can't kill the innocent.

Well,

She risked her life to give birth to you.

Don't you think she deserves to know

what you've done?

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:19.400
Whether this change

is true or not,

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:23.880
it will shake the Soldier's credibility.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.320

not to show compassion?

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:30.390
Compassion

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.450
only makes you weak!

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:33.970
But I haven't become weak.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.410
I used to believe

killing demons was the right thing to do.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.060
But now,
I feel

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.400
it's meaningless
to draw my sword for that.

That warmth

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:59.080
comes from bonds.

The bonds with family,

And humans and demons aren't so different.

If I could wish for one thing,

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:47.510
I'd want

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.660

There,

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:55.590
humans and demons can be equal

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:58.110
and respect and love each other.

Nope.

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:45.960
If you talk like this,

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.900
we can't chat anymore.

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:50.550
Fine. It does.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:53.400
Okay.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:55.790
As you know,

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.510
my father went to the Western Regions.

00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:59.590
For some reason,
he clashed with the dragon clan

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:01.450
and killed a lot of dragon demons.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:03.790
One day,

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:06.410
a descendant of a dragon demon

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:08.790
kidnapped me.

00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:22.400
Pretty lady,

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:23.510
why is this tree

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:25.160
half-dead and half-alive?

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:26.750
Did you tie that bell

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:27.790
on the branch?

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:28.960
It looks nice.

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:32.110
Why doesn't it ring, though?

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.200
How old are you?

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:37.310
13 years old.

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:38.920
I'm short now,

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.760
but my parents are both tall.

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:42.030
I'll be tall too.

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:45.000
Then you should realize

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:47.080
you've been kidnapped.

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:48.200
Yeah, I know.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.590
And I also know you're super powerful.

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:51.320
You could kill me with one slap.

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:52.480
Then why…

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.070
Am I

00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:58.350
too excited?

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:00.160
Should I be acting

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:02.310
more scared and nervous?

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:08.600
Did you bring that water

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.720
for me to drink?

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.250
You're talking so much,

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.100
so I guess you're not thirsty.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.440
So not only are you pretty,

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:19.960
but you've also got a kind heart.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:20.890
Just so you know,

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.800
if I have an asthma attack later,

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.160
don't panic.

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:26.870
It only lasts a little while.

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:29.750
I'll be fine.

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:32.470
Don't be afraid.

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.140
She was so unlucky to have kidnapped you.

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:45.070
Exactly.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.750
She was so unlucky.

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:49.280
She kidnapped me

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:51.720
to trade for her mother's dragon scale.

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:52.790
But she didn't know

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.680
my father didn't care if I lived or died.

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.320
He even wanted to kidnap her.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:58.510
So,

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:00.350
she took me and ran.

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:03.830
And then?

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:05.680
Then I

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:08.040
shamelessly followed her around.

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:09.160
She might

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:10.790
look fierce,

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.510
but deep down,

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:14.770
she was softer than anyone I had ever met.

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:17.080
Every time I had asthma,

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.000
she saved me.

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:20.290
She never said it out loud,

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:21.920
but I know—

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.420
she cared about me more than anyone else.

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:28.400
And slowly,

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.720
I started to have

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.240
different feelings for her.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:34.700
And just like that,

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:35.790
we wandered together

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:36.960
for over ten years.

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:39.200
But how did you practice swordsmanship?

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.110
I chased her.

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:43.070
She got annoyed

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:44.020
and hid from me,

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:45.230
so I kept chasing her.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.400
But she was too powerful,
and
I couldn't catch up.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.000
So,

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:49.590
I started training.

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.070
Unlike you,

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:54.090
I had no sword manuals.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.490
I learned by imitation.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.270
In the desert,

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:00.110
I watched how bugs took flight,

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:02.400
how cacti breathed,

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.240
and how lizards walked.

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.560
When the demon wind came,

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.830
I watched how bugs stayed grounded.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.000
And from that,

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.030
I found my sword path.

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.000
So your Heart of Sword

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:20.170
comes from observing all things.

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.720
Half right.

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:26.350
I'll tell you…

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.400
the rest someday.

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:31.750
So in the end,

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.000
you two still got separated?

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.530
Why else do you think

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.900
I keep looking for her?

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:38.960
But it's okay.

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:40.630
I'll find her no matter what.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:42.510
I'm off.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:43.840
All right.

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:45.550
Take care.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:48.240
Fugui,

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:50.920
the only "impossible" in this world

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.720
is the one we place on ourselves.

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:08.750
[Heaven and Earth Hall]

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:13.140
[Grand Ambition Soaring to the Heavens]

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:18.200
Good.

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:19.310
You may go now.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:20.440
Yes.

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:28.160
Master,

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:32.200
we've traced the source
of the evil medicine Chakuwa

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:33.510
sold by Xiyun Hall.

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.960
You have?

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:40.110
Then why do you look

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:41.070
unsettled, Fei?

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.380
The people from Xiyun Hall

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:44.960
were nearly all wiped out.

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:48.230
Thanks to Young Master Fugui's advice,

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:49.370
we found the person

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:51.040
who traded with Xiyun Hall.

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:52.750
He said

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:54.110
Chakuwa

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.330
was sold to him by a powerful demon.

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:57.640
A powerful demon?

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:58.200
Yes.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:28:59.720
Who is it?

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.790
This demon was extremely cautious,

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:03.720
using a disguise during the trade.

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:04.950
We couldn't even tell

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:06.680
if it was male or female.

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:08.720
But the middleman

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:09.830
was clever too.

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:12.520
He left a tracking talisman on them

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.810
and found out where they were from.

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:15.680
Where?

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:18.650
Peach Village in Dingling Mountain.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.440
That village is in a valley,

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:28.360
still part of
the Yiqi Alliance's territory.

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:31.960
The valley was shrouded
in miasma for years.

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.020
No one lived there.

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:35.250
I sent scouts to investigate.

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:38.830
They've just

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:40.400
sent word back.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:44.270
Fei,

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:46.360
what's wrong this time?

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:47.880
Why are you hesitating?

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:50.640
Master,

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:53.680
do you remember Zhang Qi, the Black Sword?

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.680
Of course.

00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:59.720
He's the heir of Zhang Zheng,
the former master of the Zhang family.

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:00.720
When he was young,

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.080
he had great insight.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:03.550
Back when I lost

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.110
my Heart of Sword outside the circle
and returned,

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:07.440
he offered me guidance.

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:11.590
The miasma in that valley
in Dingling Mountain

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:12.720
has been dispelled.

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:15.240
A village has been built there

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.200
where humans and demons live together.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.480
And the village chief is Zhang Qi.

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:46.400
Qingli!

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:47.400
Mr. Zhang is back!

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:48.240
Look.

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:01.030
Here are lots of rice cakes
made by Granny Shui,

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:02.400
and flower seeds too.

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:04.880
These rice cakes look…

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:06.880
really tasty.

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:09.030
Except for the balsam flower seeds,

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:10.030
the rest is yours.

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:12.440
Really?

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.160
Then I won't refuse.

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:21.190
I'll leave you two alone now.

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:22.000
See you.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:30.480
Qingli.

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:39.480
You've been gone for half a month.

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:43.310
This time,

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.440
I can only stay for one night.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.640
I have to leave again tomorrow morning.

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:52.720
But don't worry.

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.720
I've nearly wrapped up

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.070
my family affairs.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.400
When I go back this time,

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.510
I'll give back the Black Sword

00:32:57.510 --> 00:32:59.440
and step down as the family master.

00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:00.450
Then I'll never

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:02.640
leave you again.

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:05.400
Really?

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.310
When have I ever lied to you?

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:08.400
I'll be back

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:10.950
before the night peach blossoms bloom.

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:11.640
Okay.

00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:17.030
I'll wait for you.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:28.880
Young Master Rumu has left?

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:29.590
Yeah.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.920
He's actually

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.640
a very good person.

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:40.530
Young Master Fugui,

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:41.920
try the peanuts.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.120
They're really good.

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.110
If we made them into candy,

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:46.300
it'd be delicious!

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:48.640
What will you do next?

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:54.480
Actually,

00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:58.270
last night, I overheard your conversation

00:33:58.550 --> 00:33:59.880
with Young Master Rumu.

00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:02.440
Young Master Fugui…

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:03.800
Young Master.

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:06.890
It's Mr. Fei.

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.510
I'll take my leave now.

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:16.670
Mr. Fei.

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:17.710
How come you didn't bring

00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:19.440
a new mission scroll this time?

00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:23.070
Am I that grim in your eyes?

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.360
I don't just bring you new missions.

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:26.880
Here—

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:29.480
this is

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:30.840
what you requested.

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:32.840
See if it meets

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:33.969
your requirements.

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:37.770
Thank you, Mr. Fei.

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:40.840
This time,
I didn't come

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:42.969
to tell you to slay any powerful demon.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:44.020
But there is

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.110
a task.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.400
The evil medicine, Chakuwa,

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.659
traced back to Zhang Qi's Peach Village,

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.000
but that doesn't mean

00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:54.710
Zhang Qi himself made it.

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:57.000
That's true.

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:02.280
But both humans and demons
live in Peach Village.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.740
It's the biggest suspect.

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:06.840
Zhang Qi
is the son of Zhang Zheng.

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:09.030
And I believe

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:11.230
you know who Zhang Zheng is.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:15.230
I do.

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:17.440
He was Father's sworn brother.

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:18.030
Yeah.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.940
He died outside the circle

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:21.480
over 20 years ago.

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:23.880
That was

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:27.970
one of Father's deepest regrets.

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:31.400
It's not that Master
is

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:32.930
covering for an old friend.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.260
It's just that
he and I

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:37.320
both know Zhang Qi,
the Black Sword, very well.

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.120
He would never

00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:40.030
do such a thing.

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.920
So,

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.110
Master wants you

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:44.840
to go to Peach Village

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:46.440
and bring Zhang Qi back.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:49.550
Understood.

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.210
I won't let anything happen to him.

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:56.630
I know,

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.320
Master is

00:35:58.590 --> 00:35:59.720
too strict with you,

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:01.960
but some pain...

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:04.690
he can only keep it bottled up inside,

00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:06.470
unable to say it out loud.

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:07.480
Last night,

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:09.550
he was really upset.

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:16.030
I hope this time
you'll return in triumph.

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.320
Don't…

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.030
disappoint him again.

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.080
Don't worry, Mr. Fei.

00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:29.800
I know who I am.

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:31.440
And I know

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.220
why I was brought into this world.

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:36.070
Good.

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:38.590
Then I'll take my leave.

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:05.240
Young Master Fugui,

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:07.510
you've got a new mission?

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:10.410
You still haven't answered my question.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.110
Just now, you asked me

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:14.440
what I plan to do next.

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:16.920
Actually,

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:18.870
I haven't figured it all out yet.

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:19.770
But for now,

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:22.080
I'll go find my younger brother.

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:24.510
As for the future,

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:27.550
I'm still not sure.

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:30.150
Then before you've found your path,

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.890
come with me
to Peach Village for the mission.

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:41.280
Lady Feng.

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:50.400
She went out.

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:09.000
Why are you here?

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:11.280
Lady Feng,

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.720
I came to bring you some clothes.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:17.510
Mind your own business.

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.280
You're apparently up to no good.

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:23.840
Just get out!

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:27.920
Lady Feng,

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:29.320
I made

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:32.550
this new outfit for you by hand.

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:34.960
I hope you like it.

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:47.590
Stop.

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.070
This is

00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:54.150
a lotus?

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:55.030
Yes.

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:02.840
I've gotten over Senior Fugui.

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:04.190
But that doesn't mean

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:05.520
you two can be together.

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.250
Don't worry, Lady Feng.

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:12.360
I've already decided to leave.

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:13.280
I won't

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:14.880
come back again.

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.130
I've thought carefully

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:18.440
about what you said.

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:20.880
My staying here
would indeed

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.280
cause Young Master Fugui trouble.

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:22.960
Lady Feng,

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.280
please,

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:27.440
stay well.

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:30.450
Take good care of yourself.

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:34.440
I'm leaving.

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:38.800
Qingtong.

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.280
If only you weren't

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:45.840
a demon.

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:52.090
But if I weren't a demon,

00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:56.670
maybe I never
would've met Young Master Fugui.

00:39:58.510 --> 00:39:59.360
Am I right?

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:13.300
In this world,
only power commands respect.

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:16.630
Only if I find the Dragon Spine Sword

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:20.110
can I crush the entire Wangquan family

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.480
beneath me.

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:26.070
Master, your courage is unmatched.

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:27.360
You're one in a million.

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:28.690
You mustn't give up now.

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:38.320
Lu,

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:41.280
I know

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:45.150
you followed me
into the Sword Tomb willingly.

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:48.900
That unfilial son of mine…

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.550
he'd rather see me dead.

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:55.320
Only you…

00:40:57.550 --> 00:40:59.400
are truly loyal to me.

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:05.920
I will definitely help you

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:08.360
make it out alive.

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:14.070
Then serve me

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:16.110
with your whole heart, will you?

00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:11.590
The Black Fox was right—

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:14.360
a true dragon craves blood.

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:17.550
You want blood?

00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:19.200
I'll give you blood.

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:21.510
Wangquan Hongye,

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.070
I don't believe

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:26.360
I'll keep losing to you.

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:38.670
Quan Jingting,

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.880
your powers are gone.

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:42.800
Are you ready for the Dragon Sigh Sword

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.150
to enter your body

00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:46.670
and penetrate your tendons?

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:49.880
It'll be a long and painful process.

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:53.400
You'll slowly become
half-human and half-demon.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000
Those who stand in my way have to die.

00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:59.320
Those who hold me back
have to be abandoned.

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:02.320
Do it now!

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:05.070
Remember your promise:

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:06.840
when the time is right,

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.760
push the Soldier

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:11.320
into darkness.

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:25.800
Raise the Palanquin.

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:28.190
We set off for Peach Village
in Dingling Mountain.
