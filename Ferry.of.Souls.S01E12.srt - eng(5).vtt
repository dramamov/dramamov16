00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.840
She's coming.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.200
She's here.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.330
Protect the master!

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.560
Please don't kill me.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.720
Spare me!

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.860
Don't move.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.920
Ouch!

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.040
Take it easy!

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.570
Can't you be more manly?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.680
Master Zou.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.120
The man-eating demon shouldn't appear again tonight.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.120
Yes, yes.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.240
Thank you both, masters.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.660
Tonight was

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.040
extremely dangerous indeed.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.280
From now on, you must be extra cautious.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.360
Inform us of any unusual situations.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.320
Yes, of course.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.240
Also,

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.079
For your safety,

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.800
there are some things

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.760
I must tell you.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.760
After the man-eating demon appeared tonight,

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.680
it seems that from beginning to end,

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.079
you were its only target.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.120
Master,

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.360
what are you implying?

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.520
Is there

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.079
something you're not telling us?

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.840
What does this have to do with me?

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.560
Demons kill people.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.090
There's nothing more to it.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.320
Both of you went through a lot

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.140
to protect me tonight.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.160
I think

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.079
I'll go rest now.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.460
He probably won't tell the truth.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.690
Don't worry.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.480
Since the man-eating monster transformed from Miss Zou,

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.040
we can investigate Jinxiu Tower tonight.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.720
Let's see if

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.410
we can find any clues there.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.010
So this is Jinxiu Tower.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.720
It's so magnificent.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.610
Let's go.

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.760
Innkeeper.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.890
There's a lock on it.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.530
Impressive.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.930
Why is it so cold and gloomy in here?

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.860
And there's only one bedroom.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.740
This hardly looks like a bedroom.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.720
It's clearly a gilded birdcage.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.800
I think

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.650
it looks more like a prison.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.400
Dawn is breaking.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.170
Let's hurry and look for clues.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.300
Innkeeper.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.600
So many gold and silver jewelry.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Miss Zou is gone.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.460
Why didn't Mr. Zou put these away?

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.560
This looks

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.820
like Miss Zou deliberately hid them.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.140
Perhaps for emergencies?

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.200
That's possible.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.490
Let's keep looking.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.680
Boss.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.020
Here's a bracelet.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.810
There are two characters on it.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.159
Haitang.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.300
This bracelet must have been made

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.560
by someone very close to her.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:26.720
Boss.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.530
Have you noticed

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.760
that in this entire embroidery tower,

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.760
there are no eating utensils at all?

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.560
So that's how she died.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.520
She was starved to death.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.040
No movement outside.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.600
Everything is safe for now.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.040
Open the door quickly.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:07.960
Let's hurry.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.460
Please be careful.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.480
These teeth marks...

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.080
She must have hallucinated from hunger

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.440
and in extreme agony,

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.680
bit into this.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.600
The Zou family is so wealthy.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.730
How could anyone starve to death here?

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.400
There's another strange thing.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:27.600
Someone

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.480
seems to have never appeared at all.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.320
Who?

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.400
The magistrate's son who was to marry Miss Zou.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:35.600
Right.

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:37.220
This person

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.980
only exists in people's conversations.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.140
It's very suspicious.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.400
Let's go.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.010
Follow them.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.410
The old fox can't hold back.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.400
Let's follow and see.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.060
Innkeeper,

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.280
what should we do?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:47.600
Follow me.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:05.820
Innkeeper!

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.530
You dare to show up at my door again?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.040
This was purely an accident.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.260
I don't know why

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:13.360
Haitang

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.020
suddenly turned into a man-eating monster.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.690
I don't want to hear your explanation.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.520
My poor son

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.360
died so young.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.120
It was you

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.040
who begged me.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.360
You promised to give your daughter to my son in a ghost marriage.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.250
His son is already dead.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.400
Your promise

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.480
cannot be fulfilled now.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.960
Heaven knows my heart!

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.600
I was truly sincere

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.680
about arranging the marriage between your son

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.640
and our Haitang.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.220
To meet the auspicious wedding date,

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.600
I forced her to go without food or water for seven days and nights.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.160
When I saw she had breathed her last,

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.600
only then did I notify you

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.000
to come for the bride.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:05.760
Beast!

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.000
You don't deserve to be a father,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.760
killing your own daughter.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.450
Who knows what tricks you've been playing

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.200
to deceive me.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:17.760
Oh my!

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.920
I've damaged my karma by doing this.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.560
How would I dare deceive you?

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.040
Don't kill me.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.260
Isn't this your daughter?

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.480
Hurry!

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:09.920
Drive her away.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.400
Let her go.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.730
She's a monster now.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:13.400
I talk to her,

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.960
but she won't listen.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.600
Don't kill me.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.200
Don't kill me.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:44.760
Don't kill me.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.480
Don't kill me.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.560
Stop hurting people.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:00.700
Innkeeper!

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:01.320
Look out!

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:27.620
In just one day,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.660
how did she increase her demonic powers so much?

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.090
Could it be that man in black again?

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:50.540
Innkeeper!

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:52.680
Run!

00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.920
Go join your son.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:15.360
Look,

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.400
what mother has brought for you.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.040
You beast!

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.960
You ungrateful wretch!

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.040
I spent so much effort

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.040
and money

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.480
raising you to be beautiful as a flower,

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.080
yet you show no gratitude.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.000
I should have ended your life long ago.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:02.520
Shut up!

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:03.850
Someone like you

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.770
doesn't deserve to be a father.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.000
Haitang.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.080
That bracelet of yours...
