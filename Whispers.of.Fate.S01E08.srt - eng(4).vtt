[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.910
[Episode 8]

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.360
Master Puzhu, since you're here,

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.420
why hide yourself?

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.560
It's cold and windy outside.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.310
Please come join us.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.340
Have a taste of

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.070
the food and drink

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.420
I personally prepared.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.430
It is Master Puzhu.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.789
I observe strict religious precepts.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.190
I'm afraid I can't accept

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.430
your food and wine.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.680
Perhaps you should offer them to the souls

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.810
of the Ranqing Sect who died unjustly.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.940
Sir, do you believe

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.800
I killed those people?

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.079
Even if it wasn't you directly,

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:24.430
you were still involved.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.430
You're truly blinded by prejudice.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.240
Or perhaps

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.520
you and the Central Plains Sword Alliance

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.310
are willingly

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.710
being manipulated by the Blood Ghost Pill?

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.730
The one known to kill all with one strike,

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.310
Shisan Tower's

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.080
Shen Langhun.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.120
This is

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.730
the evidence you wanted me to see?

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:10.630
He's wounded.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.720
Westwind Slashing Wildfire.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.190
The Sword King has been
by my side all along.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.470
When did you fight him?

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.510
Strange, isn't it?

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.960
Master Puzhu

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.000
I'm afraid you've fallen into
Yu Qifeng's trap.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.240
Yu Qifeng killing to silence witnesses

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.370
is nothing unusual.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.240
But the dead

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.220
cannot come back to life.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.890
Yu Qifeng will be exposed eventually.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.080
That's why Mr. Tang

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.190
deliberately took me
to the Tianyan Sword Wall.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.250
It was to force Yu Qifeng to make a move

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.740
and frame me before the public trial.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.190
Shen Langhun,

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.070
it's you!

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.830
And Master Puzhu,

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.870
you happened to become the witness.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.150
To prove that

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.590
the Shen Langhun I was chasing

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:38.650
was an impostor...

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.000
I had the self-proclaimed

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.430
clever Sword King Yu

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.360
to create

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.360
an alibi for Shen.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:58.920
Shen Langhun!

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.450
What a clever counter-scheme.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.420
When a rat steals food,

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.400
is it possible for it
to be caught by a cat

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.190
while simultaneously

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.850
being trapped in a mousetrap?

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.920
Certainly not.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.830
Then,

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.160
the rat

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.890
with its tail cut off by the trap

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.440
cannot be the same one in the cat's paws.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:33.430
This is merely

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.290
Mr. Tang's one-sided statement.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.130
I'm not here to clear my name.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:38.560
I only want Master Puzhu

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.990
to know there are
other suspicious individuals.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.630
You shouldn't focus solely on me.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.120
Don't you want to know

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.360
where the rat

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.070
that you couldn't catch today

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.190
came from?

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:48.330
Tomorrow at noon,

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.120
you are cordially invited

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.250
to the Lake Pavilion

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:52.970
in Sword King City.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.710
You still haven't told us

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:18.800
about what you and that monk outside

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.460
were being mysterious about.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.600
Master Puzhu

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.860
is a lay disciple of Tianjing Pavilion.

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.030
What were you and that rat

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.480
being mysterious about?

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.430
Master Puzhu is the cat.

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:35.490
What about the rat then?

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:38.590
The rat is obviously...

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.630
Shen always wears black

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.880
and likes to hide in shadows to kill.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.540
He really does resemble a rat.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:59.390
He's angry?

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:00.820
He got angry at that?

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.680
That's unnecessary.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:11.880
Chi, what's wrong?

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:16.560
Zhong.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:23.630
Well,

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.390
Shen has also been to the dungeon.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:27.000
How can we prove

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.280
he didn't kill Jiang Qingyu?

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.340
No need to prove it.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.600
Because there's no need to clear

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.600
my suspicion.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.090
I just need to make Puzhu

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:35.390
suspect Yu Qifeng

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:36.780
and the goal

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.800
will be achieved.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:41.990
Foxy Tang,

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:43.510
you're something else!

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:44.970
Don't celebrate too soon.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:45.860
Why?

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:46.920
I'm guessing

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:48.920
the upcoming public trial at Qiongtai

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.800
is where Yu Qifeng

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.200
plans to turn the tables.

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:52.060
It's a trap?

00:07:52.159 --> 00:07:53.490
Then are we still going?

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.390
Of course we are.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.160
It's time

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.420
to turn the tables on them.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:16.910
Miss Hong,

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.190
I never thought

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:20.670
Puzhu's Light Technique
would be so powerful.

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:22.070
I almost got exposed.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:23.920
You went to great lengths

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.310
to lure Puzhu in there.

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:27.920
Yet he didn't take anyone away.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.530
Shen Langhun wasn't captured?

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:31.830
Why?

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:34.360
You weren't exposed,

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.960
but Yu Qifeng

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:37.750
was.

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:41.169
I don't understand.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.120
Why does the Master

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.480
insist on using this fool

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.640
to deal with Tang Lici?

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.470
Even if the Master doesn't trust us,

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:47.900
if we called on
the East and West Palace Chiefs,

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.760
we could've dealt with Tang Lici.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.280
We have more important matters

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.370
to attend to in Sword King City.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:55.970
What about Yu Qifeng?

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.930
We needn't concern ourselves
with his fate.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.180
Commander, we lost them.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:53.550
Chi,

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.290
drinking on an empty stomach isn't good.

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:57.490
Have some sweet soup.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.510
It doesn't feel right.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.550
Shen went off

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:03.630
with Foxy Tang to fight.

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:04.230
Thank you.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.030
I, the great master Cloud,

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.840
am reduced to drinking sweet soup here.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:34.720
That move...

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.510
Could it be him?

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.850
An old friend has returned.

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.910
It's him. So cool!

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:20.910
Such a greeting is truly...

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:22.870
something I've rarely seen before.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:24.440
Don't hit below the belt.

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:38.280
Beauty,

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.980
what happened just now

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:41.710
was because I saw you all

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:43.010
looking so glum,

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.270
and wanted to cheer you up.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.670
It was carefully prepared.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:46.910
Convincing, wasn't it?

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:48.510
Miss Shei, please accept it.

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:49.360
Otherwise,

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.370
Senior Xue might not

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.240
sleep well for the whole year

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.670
after that embarrassment.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:59.060
Thank you.

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:05.070
Senior Xue Xianzi,

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:07.360
I was the glummest person just now.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.680
Do I also get

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:10.840
flowers?

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.410
Yes.

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:14.260
There's food to eat.

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:15.320
Let's eat first.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.120
Let's eat.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:34.840
Not to brag,

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:36.010
but I, Xue Xianzi,

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:37.720
was born to enjoy the good life.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.050
Look,

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.720
even though I owe you money,

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.670
you still have to

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.060
treat me to fine food and wine, don't you?

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:43.910
Just for this alone,

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:45.440
you're being very good to me.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.030
If there's even one fingerprint

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:47.320
on this clothing,

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:49.690
your repayment period

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:52.400
will likely be extended by another year.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.580
This little fox

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:58.160
dresses opulently every day.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.120
Don't you know

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:00.000
to hide your wealth?

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:00.330
Come.

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:01.610
Let me.

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:02.910
Let me, let me.

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:08.080
Senior, Senior,

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:11.030
I, Chi Yun, have admired you
for a long time.

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:13.910
At Tiandu Peak,

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:16.030
you fought fiercely
against the Jile Sect's nine villains.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.240
At Maoya Peak, you swept through
thousands of troops.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.770
With just one sword strike,

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:22.000
you made the master
of Jiangling's Yu family...

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:22.790
Yang family.

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:25.690
Made the master of Jiangling's Yang family

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:26.920
too scared to say a word.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.640
What heroic bearing!

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.890
Well, I've been out of practice
for a long time.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:35.140
Let's not mention
such trivial matters anymore.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:36.410
Don't mention it again.

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:36.890
Senior,

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:38.200
I have

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.910
a treasured portrait here.

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:41.720
I'd like to ask you to...

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.120
I...

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:45.390
I...

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:46.000
Here.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:51.200
When you pressed here,

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.730
pressing on your own heart,

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:55.190
it was like pressing on my heart too.

00:13:58.140 --> 00:13:59.260
But seriously,

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:00.870
that old Yu's Westwind Slashing Wildfire

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:02.200
did have some issues.

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.310
The Eight Winds Yanhuang Sword Manual

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.820
has always been powered
by righteous energy.

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:07.910
But his sword essense

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:09.970
had surprisingly heavy evil energy.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:11.360
So,

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.240
just Yu Qifeng alone

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.240
is enough to give anyone a headache.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.500
If

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:19.270
that sworn brother of yours

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:20.600
comes looking for you

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.570
and they join forces,

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:22.750
then that fox head of yours

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:24.210
will be chopped off again.

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:29.670
Of course,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.030
if you receive help

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.720
from a rare master...

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.370
For only 20,000,

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:39.690
I can manage to do it.

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:44.730
No need.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.360
At least name a price.

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:50.070
Ten thousand.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.740
Before I leave Sword King City,

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:52.820
if I need you again,

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.390
you must help.

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:56.810
Ten thousand is too little.

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:57.680
I won't fight Puzhu,

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.650
won't fight Yu Qifeng,

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:00.510
and won't fight your sworn enemy.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.120
That won't do.

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:03.750
If you get killed,

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:04.980
who

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:07.300
will I collect my debt from?

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.610
You clever fox.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:10.900
Ten thousand it is.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:41.090
It's almost noon.

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.280
Mr. Tang, shouldn't you be leaving

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.240
to meet with Master Puzhu?

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.200
Scheming isn't needed with a gentleman.

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:51.430
Sincerity is all that's needed.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:53.440
Last night, Master Puzhu

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.840
did not capture Shen.

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:57.200
Yu Qifeng and Fengliu Shop's plot

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.630
to kill by another's hand

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:00.520
has already failed.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.510
To win with a follow-up move,

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:03.360
we must expose the connection

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.560
between the Yu family

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:06.120
and Fengliu Shop to everyone.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.080
Turning their attack
against them is the best strategy.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.270
But Yu Qifeng isn't stupid.

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:11.130
He must have hidden the evidence.

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:15.410
A cornered dog will seek its master.
That's when the show begins.

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:18.770
Foxy Tang.

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:20.150
What's my task?

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.040
I'm standing right here.

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:23.610
Can't you see me?

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.550
Patience.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.150
Master Puzhu

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:34.680
came here for the Evil Pill.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.150
We should certainly help him

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:37.030
find evidence

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:38.810
of Yu Qifeng's involvement
with it.

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:41.470
Only then will we have leverage
to work with him.

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:42.840
However,

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:44.030
this evidence

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.030
must be hidden very well.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.600
But I have my ways

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.840
to make the evidence come to us.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.910
This most difficult task

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:55.390
will fall upon you,

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:56.870
great hero Chi.

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:00.640
Am I that important?

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:01.960
Tell me.

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:03.880
What do you want me to do?

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:06.880
This task

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:09.829
is both fun and impressive.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.280
Moreover,

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:14.010
you'll have three subordinates,

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:16.650
guaranteeing quite an impressive presence.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.089
That's exactly what I want.

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:23.609
What?

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:25.089
How is this a nice task?

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:27.200
So, Mr. Tang

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.530
called us to gather here

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:30.080
just for...

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:35.750
Take a look!

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.860
Fragrant and sweet!

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.590
Baked flatbread!

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:43.550
Sir,

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:45.570
a bowl of wontons, please.

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:46.900
You go ahead.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.610
There are too many people here.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:50.690
You do it.

00:17:58.750 --> 00:17:59.590
What?

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.190
The master of Wanqiao Chamber?

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:04.320
Yes,

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:06.650
it's that master of Wanqiao Chamber.

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:07.750
People say

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.760
he's part of the imperial family

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.270
and is in charge of
the imperial family's procurement.

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:13.930
The money he handles each year

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.640
amounts to half the empire's wealth.

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:18.270
Since it's procurement,

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:20.600
there must be imperial transport, right?

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:22.030
I just wonder

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:23.830
which shipping company he uses.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.350
I think I heard that

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:29.070
they...

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.200
they came here this time

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:32.550
to find

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:33.960
a suitable fleet

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.660
to transport their goods.

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:36.720
Wanqiao Chamber

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:38.170
is wealthy beyond measure.

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:39.920
What treasures don't they have?

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:41.000
If this deal goes through,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.180
we'll definitely get rich.

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:42.940
However,

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:44.000
I don't know

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:45.420
how to contact with them.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:47.830
It's actually quite simple.

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:49.110
Wanqiao Chamber is opening

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:50.050
a branch in Sword King City.

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:51.680
They need the Boat Guild right now.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:52.750
They only require

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:55.580
cooperation with major clients
for over 3 years

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.550
and you can go
discuss details at the dock.

00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:00.350
Since this is a key location
for imperial transport,

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:02.550
there should be many qualified candidates.

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:04.210
Indeed, there should be many.

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:04.790
I

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.750
happen to have worked with
Sword King Yu before,

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:08.350
so I believe

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:10.070
I meet Wanqiao Chamber's requirements.

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.750
Is that so?

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:13.200
I'll go now

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:13.880
and have my assistant

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.160
prepare the account books.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:15.690
This way,

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.480
I can prove my qualifications.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:20.160
I should prepare thoroughly as well.

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:21.960
Wait.

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:24.160
Did you hear that?

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:26.010
What a great opportunity!

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:26.720
I need to hurry

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.400
and prepare my account books too.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.200
If I'm late, I'll miss my chance.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:34.920
Foxy Tang, the fish is in the pond.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.480
Sir, you left in such a hurry.

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:59.400
Our conversation was cut short last night,

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.330
so I had to trouble you again today.

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:50.370
Before you start making excuses,

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:51.310
I have

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:53.050
a few questions to ask.

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:56.230
Please go ahead, Sir.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.500
In the Hao Wenhou murder case,

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:00.710
with your abilities,

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.530
if you had acted sooner,

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:04.240
Yang Shangqing wouldn't have been

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.370
silenced by murder.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:06.140
Jiang Cheng

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:08.160
wouldn't have died either.

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:12.030
For those who tainted
by the Blood Ghost Pill,

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:13.290
it's merely a question of

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:14.940
dying sooner or later.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.940
In the Yanmen Sect incident,

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:19.880
even Master Jiang

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:21.480
couldn't do anything to you.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.140
You willingly entered Yanmen's prison

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:26.200
to lure the Fengliu Shop into action.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:30.760
If not for this,

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:32.880
how could I have drawn out

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.280
a big fish like Yu Qifeng?

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.480
But have you ever considered

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:39.440
that Miss Zhong and those close to you

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.740
were put in danger because of this,

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:41.950
as was Yanmen Sect?

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.860
Innocent people might've been implicated.

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:50.750
What about those
poisoned by the Blood Ghost Pill?

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:52.210
Aren't they innocent too?

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.970
Sacrificing the innocent
to save the innocent

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:55.880
is not justice,

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:57.270
nor is it heroic.

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:00.180
I never claimed to be a hero,

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.750
nor have I ever pretended
to stand for justice.

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:04.720
These concepts are useless

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.070
in the face

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:08.440
of real conspiracies and schemes.

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:10.310
Sophistry!

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.860
You're stubbornly unrepentant.

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:13.590
I must ask you

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:15.540
to leave Sword King City immediately.

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:16.400
As for Yu Qifeng

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.400
and his collusion with the Fengliu Shop,

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.330
I will investigate it personally.

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:22.510
So, are you saying

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:23.960
you already know

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.460
where the other rat

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:26.830
came from?

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.070
You and Master Shao

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:32.640
of the Sword Alliance

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.510
have both been searching

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.160
for the Fengliu Shop

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.960
without any success,

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:40.250
right?

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.110
If you want to find

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:48.200
the mastermind behind the Fengliu Shop,

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:48.840
you

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.000
can't do it without me.

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:52.440
As for everything else,

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:54.110
I'm not interested.

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:01.000
So the lives of others

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:02.880
mean nothing to you?

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.720
You would sacrifice everyone

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.220
just to force out that one person?

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:13.550
You disregard human lives.

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.280
Keeping you here
would bring endless trouble.

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:27.430
Our paths differ.

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.570
We can still work together.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.070
While we're here

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:12.130
discussing these useless feelings,

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.140
the mastermind behind all this

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.000
may already be making their move.

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.650
If trouble stirs in the city again,

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:20.070
will it

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:22.440
really be my fault

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:24.200
or yours?

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:41.310
Please allow me to take your pulse.

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:57.440
Candied haws!

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:58.550
Sweet candied haws!

00:26:58.550 --> 00:26:59.790
Come take a look!

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:00.680
Little charms!

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.510
Fragrant and sweet!

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:02.370
Thank you, sir.

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:03.110
Take care.

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:04.550
Mom, we have a kite now!

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:06.480
We can finally go fly it!

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:07.400
Yes, hold it carefully.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.310
Kites!

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:09.910
Kites!

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:10.920
Come see!

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:12.790
Fox kites!

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:14.320
Sir,

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:15.880
the third day of the Sword Duel Festival

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:17.260
happens to be the Double Ninth Festival.

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:20.110
This fox kite symbolizes
good fortune and prosperity.

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:21.510
Would you like to buy one?

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.440
The Double Ninth Festival

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.040
is perfect for flying kites.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:26.400
Fly?

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:29.940
How could I possibly let him go?

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.310
Get out of here!

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.770
No money, no treatment.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:35.480
Get lost!

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:36.880
Go as far as you can.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.140
Don't dirty our place.

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:40.550
You want to get treated without money?

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:41.680
Please, have mercy.

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:42.650
My chest hurts.

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:43.810
Have mercy?

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:48.030
Get away from here,

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:48.960
you sick wretch.

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:50.400
I can tell

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:51.650
you don't have much time left anyway.

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:53.300
I'll do you a favor today.

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.300
Go buy a mat to be buried in.

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:00.410
I'll accept

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:02.880
this consultation fee.

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:28.240
Try breathing in and out three times.

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:32.030
It doesn't hurt anymore.

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:33.830
It really doesn't hurt anymore.

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:36.200
Impressive!

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:39.030
This young man's medical skills
are remarkable.

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:41.270
Just three needles
and the illness is gone.

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:42.930
I don't cough or itch anymore.

00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:45.760
Benefactor.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:49.190
Thank you, benefactor!

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.110
You truly are

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:52.170
a miracle doctor who heals the world.

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:54.590
A true miracle doctor!

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:55.920
So remarkable!

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:58.350
Thank you for your kindness.

00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:59.680
Thank you, benefactor.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.210
Thank you, benefactor.

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:04.440
Bravo!

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.350
So impressive!

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:06.750
Miracle doctor!

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.440
Amazing!

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.030
Great!

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:11.810
Miracle doctor!

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.160
Impressive.

00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:36.550
After holding a sword to kill for so long,

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.310
I've almost forgotten

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:42.110
what it feels like
to use needles for acupuncture.

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:45.120
Lici.

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:48.820
This gentleman is not only kind,

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:50.100
but also so handsome.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:51.920
Shallow.

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:54.540
Who are you talking about?

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:55.960
You even admire Foxy Tang.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.960
You clearly don't understand this.

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:01.010
Miss Shei, let's go.

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:05.110
As if you're the only one with taste.

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:07.030
If I don't have taste, who does?

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.550
I wonder what it'll feel like

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:10.480
to kill these new friends

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:13.450
of yours.

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:27.470
What's wrong, Chi?

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:28.200
Let's go.

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:29.690
It's nothing.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.140
Did you find anything?

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.680
The heart disease
has penetrated your bones.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.410
Your vital energy is depleted.

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.540
Since your days are numbered,

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:52.490
why bother?

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:55.480
I don't have the same mindset as you, Sir.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.940
I lack the enlightenment
to save all beings.

00:30:58.030 --> 00:30:59.160
If I want to survive,

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:00.640
I must

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.780
find the mastermind behind Fengliu Shop.

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:03.980
Can he save your life?

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:05.830
Of course not.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:07.970
Then what are you after?

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:11.440
He can't,

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:12.790
but finding him

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:14.230
can.

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:17.930
Since we are not adversaries,

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:19.050
we can cooperate.

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:20.910
Otherwise, we both lose.

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.740
It will only allow the Blood Ghost Pill

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:25.670
to continue spreading poison
throughout the world.

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:27.570
Everything you do

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:30.270
is just to save your own life.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.150
It's precisely because

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:33.550
I only care about myself.

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:34.840
Thus,

00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:36.960
what I want and what you want

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:38.480
are not in conflict.

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:40.580
Why should I conspire with

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:42.210
someone who cares about nothing?

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:43.140
Desperate times

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.100
call for desperate measures.

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:46.520
If we judge everything by intention,

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.520
nothing will ever be accomplished.

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:51.340
Master Puzhu and Master Shao,

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.200
the evidence you cannot find

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.440
using your honorable methods

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:55.610
is not difficult to obtain

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:56.740
for someone like me.

00:31:57.030 --> 00:31:58.230
Just this point alone

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:00.310
is enough to tempt you, Sir.

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:01.960
How arrogant.

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:09.750
I certainly have reason to be arrogant.

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:10.550
Otherwise,

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:12.030
you wouldn't have

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:14.160
come personally to test my abilities.

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:15.880
The Sword Alliance has internal conflicts.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:16.720
Master Shao

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:18.920
wants to start with Sword King City

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.580
to eliminate the Fengliu Shop

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:23.200
but lacks a suitable tool.

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:24.170
Am I right?

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:30.820
I'm not afraid of a bad reputation.

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:32.220
This particular quality

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:33.550
is perfectly useful

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:34.950
for you two.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:36.170
However,

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:38.110
my sword only points

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.160
in the direction I choose.

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:45.150
Sir, if you still don't trust me,

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.730
why don't we

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:47.780
make a bet?

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:48.960
What bet?

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:50.240
I'll provide a list
of everyone in Sword King City

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.240
who has taken the Evil Pill,

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:52.990
as well as

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:54.720
evidence of Yu Qifeng

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.380
selling the Blood Ghost Pill.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:57.650
Tonight,

00:32:57.890 --> 00:32:59.940
I will personally deliver
the list and evidence

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:01.180
to you.

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:02.380
And

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:05.280
I won't harm a single innocent person.

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:12.580
What do you want in return?

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:15.070
Your cooperation with my plan.

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:16.520
Apart from that,

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:19.030
you must not interfere

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:21.430
with any other matters
within Sword King City.

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:22.630
You won't work with me

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:24.430
and instead want me

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:25.520
to stay out of it?

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.280
What's the wager?

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:30.550
If you interfere with matters
in Sword King City,

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:31.720
then you lose.

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:33.070
Conversely,

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:34.720
if I fail to

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.510
deliver the list and evidence to you,

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:36.990
or

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:38.720
if any innocent person is harmed

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:39.680
during the capture

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.550
of Yu Qifeng,

00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:43.380
then I lose.

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:46.740
If I lose,

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:50.100
you may hand me over
to the Sword Alliance...

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:54.880
to be dealt with as they see fit.

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:19.280
Red leaves float,

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:20.550
red leaves swirl,

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.320
phoenix flowers bloom with ancient glory.

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:24.840
Test sword essence,

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:26.070
fly paper kites,

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.880
ascend together to honor the Yanhuang Way.

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:49.090
The battle of Tiandu Peak?

00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:21.140
Thankfully, that demon is dead.

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:22.000
The seven masters

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.400
almost couldn't defeat him.

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:25.550
What kind of monster
are you talking about?

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:26.960
If it weren't for Master Xuanqing

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:27.760
and Head Fang,

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.760
we wouldn't have today's prosperity.

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.320
It's such a pity about Head Fang.

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:32.320
Such a good person

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.070
died just like that.

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:14.430
Lici,

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:16.360
why did you kill me?

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:19.310
Lici, why did you kill me?

00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:22.860
Lici.

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.170
Lici.

00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:28.540
Lici.

00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:25.860
Thank you, sir.

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.360
What were you thinking about just now,

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:30.690
to be so lost in thought?

00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:39.790
Can you help me choose

00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:41.940
which of these two hairpins

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.080
suits me better?

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:54.550
This one

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.030
suits you better.

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.150
This hairpin is prettier.

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:01.670
This hairpin

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.120
is sharper and more pointed.

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:07.390
When you encounter bad people,

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:09.110
you can use it as a weapon.

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:15.170
There are many bones here.

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:25.020
Stab here

00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:27.270
and it will be easier to succeed.

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:34.480
You're quite amusing, sir.

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:36.320
I'll remember that.

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:16.110
The master offers 30,000 taels of gold

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:17.360
to rent Qiongtai

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.360
for tomorrow's banquet.

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:21.910
Jiang Qingyu is dead,

00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:24.490
so Shen Langhun is the culprit.

00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:26.360
Master Puzhu and I

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.220
witnessed this with our own eyes.

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:30.490
If Tang Lici truly cares about the truth,

00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:31.920
he should hand over Shen Langhun

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:32.630
to us

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.360
and explain to all martial arts fellows

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.840
why the criminal

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:39.010
happens to be his subordinate.

00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:41.490
But the owner said someone framed him.

00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:45.060
The master also says

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:46.400
only the true culprit

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.400
would get as angry as the Sword King.

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:52.210
The master knows everything.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.250
It seems the Sword King
isn't so great after all.

00:39:57.250 --> 00:39:59.080
Indeed, not so great.

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:01.670
Children speak without filters.

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:02.840
Please forgive them, Sword King.

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:03.550
However,

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:04.910
hosting this banquet

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.810
to reveal the truth to everyone

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:08.880
was also Master Puzhu's intention.

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:19.750
Sword King,

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:22.360
would you reconsider?

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:34.840
I'll allow it.

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:37.090
Thank you, Sword King.

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:42.590
This way, everyone.

00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:50.840
Tang Lici!

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:31.130
I have used my own flesh and blood

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:32.660
to refine it for four years.

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:34.690
Once it's complete,

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:37.300
it will become your weakness.

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:43.570
Master,

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:44.860
you...

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.030
What is it?

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:52.210
Master, I, Yu Qifeng, request an audience.

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:03.630
Go back.

00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:05.700
The Master doesn't want to see you.

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.320
Everyone thinks
they're good at planning and adapting,

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.050
hiding their true intentions.

00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:15.880
But when facing major events,

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:18.080
decisions are often made in an instant,

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:19.670
driven by emotions,

00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:20.990
such as jealousy,

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:21.970
anger,

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:22.730
and sadness.

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:24.830
They're irrational behaviors.

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:27.440
When someone looks at you
a moment too long,

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.880
you yell at them.

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:30.780
When someone insults you,

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:32.740
you must fight back.

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:35.280
If your loved ones
suffer from misfortunes,

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:36.400
you want to make the other party

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:37.280
and their entire family perish.

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:37.790
Huiniang.

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:39.190
An eye for an eye.

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:40.110
Huiniang.

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:44.150
Huiniang!

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:45.770
Promise me.

00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:47.710
If you meet Liu Yan,

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.080
you must not act rashly.

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:50.960
Why?

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:54.230
I have my own way to help you get revenge.

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:55.070
But for now,

00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:56.770
if you see him,

00:42:57.570 --> 00:42:58.380
run away.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:01.020
Promise me.

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:02.580
Promise me.

00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:04.770
You always talk about justice,

00:43:04.770 --> 00:43:06.070
but that's only
when things haven't happened

00:43:06.070 --> 00:43:06.920
to yourself.

00:43:06.970 --> 00:43:09.750
Once disaster befalls you,
all you'll think about

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:11.790
is an eye for an eye,

00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:13.120
a tooth for a tooth.

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:16.400
Don't you think

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:18.000
I'm right?

00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:34.410
It's my technique.

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:36.780
But who are you?

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.320
That look in your eyes...

00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:43.170
You hate me.

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:45.890
We have a grudge?

00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:56.410
You've gotten your revenge.

00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:57.880
Are you happy now?

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:03.870
I remember now.

00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:05.130
Your eyes.

00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:06.150
You look like him.

00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:07.280
Too bad.

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:09.550
With your limited skills,

00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:11.180
you still can't kill me.

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:15.790
Shen... Lang... Hun.

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:27.400
Rebirth Scroll.

00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:29.950
Tang Lici's things may be disgusting,

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:31.940
but they still have some use.

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:34.990
Die!

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:36.640
