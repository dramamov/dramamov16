00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.140
with the Shadow Sect's stance,

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.300
it can only vanish.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.980
So if the Shadow Sect stopped being itself

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.100
and put on the Imperial Father-in-Law's name,

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.060
is that what it means

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:50.420
for a shadow

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.490
to stand in the light?

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:55.420
So,

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.820
what Yi Bu said just now

00:15:58.510 --> 00:15:59.730
wasn't only a curse on us...

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.820
it mirrors his own lot.

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:06.610
What are you thinking about?

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:10.980
Nothing.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:12.650
Oh...

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:15.850
this is for you.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:16.940
What is it?

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.180
These were in your compartment.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:20.580
I didn't check it.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.220
You've never remembered

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:23.180
your childhood, have you?

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:24.820
See what's written on it.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:36.730
The past...

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:40.850
why fuss over it?

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.060
From here on, Blood River,

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:45.460
you and I...

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.220
have only tomorrow!

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.750
[Ever Forward]

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:55.220
Your Highness.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.010
General.

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:58.010
The Imperial Father-in-Law's Manor is ablaze.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.010
Looks like... Blood River won.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.100
What about the Prince of Langya?

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.650
He was ambushed at Fengxiao Temple,

00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:05.530
but he seems unharmed.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:06.490
Right now,

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:07.660
he's returning with the Guardian Azure Dragon,

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:08.180
Li Xinyue.

00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:14.050
You may go.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.380
The Shadow Sect really is worthless.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.220
I'd hoped this bout

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.090
would leave them and the Langya faction

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.810
both crippled.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.050
So be it.

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:35.220
So be it.

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:37.140
With the Shadow Sect gone,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.700
Father's fear of the Prince of Langya

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:41.180
only deepens.

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:44.490
Which means

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.420
it's time to set my board.

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:57.770
Muyu.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.290
Who's the Patriarch here anyway?

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:01.530
Why doesn't anyone

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:02.530
greet me first?

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:07.180
How'd those goons

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:08.460
you ran into fare?

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.570
Changli's crew are handling the bodies.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.180
The Fengxiao Temple mission wrapped too.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.290
Uncle Qidao has gone back ahead.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.620
As for Mu Ciling,

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:17.010
he said

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:18.250
he's heading to the inn to heal first.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.620
When "dear Muyu" is done,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.010
go cure his poison.

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:25.490
After that he'll be done

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:26.700
with Blood River.

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:27.940
Fine.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.460
I'll go in a bit.

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:33.460
I meant to wait at the inn.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.290
Didn't expect we'd meet here first.

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:41.860
You acted recklessly again?

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:51.980
Your inner force is nearly spent.

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:56.180
It will cost a lot of my good medicine.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:59.570
I wasn't reckless.

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.730
I did what I could.

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.980
He can vouch for me.

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:10.530
I...

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.660
I don't take your word for it.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:18.700
Xuewei and I

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:19.900
will check on Changli.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.530
If they're done,

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:23.050
we'll head back to the house.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.090
Young miracle physician,

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:29.570
I tried to kill you last time...

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:31.490
Sorry about that.

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:33.620
No worries.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:34.770
We were just on different sides.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:35.900
Don't dwell on it.

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:37.050
It's all in the past.

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:39.530
Farewell.

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.980
Farewell.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.980
Farewell.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:47.730
Get lost.

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:10.180
You're not taking your best buddy here?

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.460
I took it as a given you'd come with me.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:18.860
At Wanjuan Tower,

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:20.980
I learned a few things

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:22.420
about No-Sword City.

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:25.140
I need to make a trip to Homeland.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:26.940
Homeland?

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:30.380
Why are you still wasting time here?

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:32.250
Everything's packed?

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.570
We're assassins out to kill.

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:35.730
What's there to pack?

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.490
My father headed back

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:38.290
to Nan'an City ahead of me.

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:39.380
What about you two?

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.250
Coming with us

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:42.810
or heading back to Blood River?

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:51.900
I've got matters to handle.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:54.620
Once they're done,

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.420
I'll come to Nan'an for you.

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:02.050
All right.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:12.860
You may go.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:13.730
Got it.

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:18.820
[Xiao Ruojin, Emperor Mingde]

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:23.810
Your Majesty.

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:27.940
Here so early to see me,

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:29.570
what is it?

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.770
[Jin Xuan, Great Eunuch]
Last night the Shadow Sect burned down.

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:34.570
Imperial Father-in-Law Yi Bu

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:36.570
was burned to death.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.460
Yi Bu is dead?

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:40.730
Yes.

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:42.460
The blaze was massive.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.050
The entire manor is gone.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.330
Countless casualties.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:51.860
So that means...

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:54.420
From last night,

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:56.810
the Shadow Sect no longer exists.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.220
Did he need to be that ruthless?

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.490
Two of a trade seldom agree.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:08.660
Besides,

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.770
he never liked Yi Bu.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.180
Was it really him?

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.700
A secret report reached the palace

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:22.620
that last night,

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.730
he wasn't at his own manor.

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:27.570
Ending it so absolutely

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.330
doesn't quite fit his style.

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:32.770
But our prince

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:35.860
isn't the man he was anymore,

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:37.490
is he?

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:44.530
Enough.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.290
Call it an accidental fire

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:47.620
and leave it at that.

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:49.490
Have the Court of Judicial Review handle it.

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:51.010
As you command.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.380
Has Consort Xuan

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:55.140
heard the news?

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:56.730
The Seventh Prince

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.730
entered the palace this morning.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.860
By now, Her Ladyship

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:04.250
must know as well.

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:12.620
[Prince of Langya's Manor]

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.440
Why would Blood River

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:20.380
help us wipe out the Shadow Sect?

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.490
You think I hired them?

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:27.770
Those earlier attempts on my life

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.570
were staged as a setup.

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:32.940
It's not what I think.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.090
It's what everyone in Tianqi City will think.

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:36.900
They'll all link the fall of the Shadow Sect to you.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.050
And your elder brother

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:41.090
will think so too.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.770
Then let them think so. I don't care.

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.940
I don't believe

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.330
you'd choose that method.

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:51.010
Which is why you and I can be friends.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.010
This wasn't my doing.

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:55.530
Yi Bu dug his own grave,

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.770
you could say.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.420
Su Changhe and Su Muyu of Blood River

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:00.800
are remarkable.

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:02.330
They said they'd change Blood River.

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:04.460
I don't think that's empty talk.

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:06.290
They've cut every chain

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:07.620
on their necks.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.380
They're no longer someone else's pawns.

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:11.050
The only shackles left

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:14.460
are rumor and prejudice.

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:18.730
But that's the hardest part.

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.770
If I can,

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.980
I'll lend them a hand.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.180
Su Muyu?

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:33.940
Su Muyu?

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.770
Let's go hear a tune together!

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:36.700
Su...

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.160
[Tianqi]

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.320
Once we leave,

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.330
who knows when we'll return to Tianqi City.

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:51.180
I hope when we come back,

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.380
we can truly walk the long street

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.530
with nothing weighing on our minds.

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:56.980
Walk through the Entertainment Street

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.420
with nothing on your mind, huh?

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.660
That's your father's wish.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.090
You little brat,

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.770
teasing Uncle Zhe again.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.250
Changhe.

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:13.490
We'll make our dream come true,

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:14.450
won't we?

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:16.380
You call that a dream?
