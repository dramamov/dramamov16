00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.960
Is anybody there?

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.060
Open the door quickly!

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.400
Open up!

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.440
Yunniang!

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.840
Yunniang is missing!

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.759
Sister!

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.640
Sister!

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.960
I searched everywhere for Yunniang.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.520
Sister,

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.010
but she was nowhere to be found.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.840
Until one day,

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.720
I saw Scholar Yang on the street.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.480
Why are you here again?

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.920
Weren't you forbidden to come?

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.120
That's when I learned

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.720
that the normally well-dressed scholar

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.640
was actually a gambling addict in private.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.320
Yunniang's disappearance

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.040
must be connected to him.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.930
It didn't take long for me to figure out

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.480
it was him.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.980
To get gambling money,

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.770
he sold Yunniang to the gambling house owner.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.280
The gambling house owner, to bribe the county officials,

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.200
gave Yun Niang to Secretary Zhao.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.960
My poor sister

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.040
survived only a few days under Secretary Zhao

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.840
before being tortured to death.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.450
How could I swallow this anger?

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.810
They deserve to die.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.440
But why use such means

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.040
and sacrifice yourself too?

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.320
As long as I can avenge my sister,

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.280
I don't care what happens to me.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.600
This is the only keepsake my sister left me.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.000
Sister.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.680
Niaoniao won't be with you anymore.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.320
Don't be afraid.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.400
Kill her.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.280
Kill her.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.440
She's the real culprit.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.540
Innkeeper,

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.020
what's wrong with her?

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.120
Kill her!

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.920
She's the one to blame.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.320
Kill her!

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.080
Watch out!

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:12.540
Innkeeper!

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.120
Are you alright?

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.540
Innkeeper!

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.480
Yunniang is already gone.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.600
It's time for you to let go.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.800
What an adorable little pig!

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.040
Look how tiny it is,

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.960
and chubby,

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.240
and so delightful!

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.560
It's a good omen.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.000
Why don't we keep it

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.250
and raise it at home?

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.400
This girl is really in trouble.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.920
She's quite pitiful.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.280
Let's help her.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.600
Silly girl.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.050
You're still young.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.000
You'll have to get married when you grow up.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.720
Sister.

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.800
Sister.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.880
Sister.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.840
Sister.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.600
Sister.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.640
Sister.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:33.920
Boss,

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.120
you're back.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.680
What?

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.560
Did I disappoint you?

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.680
Boss,

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:44.400
I was wrong.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.080
Who put you up to this?

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.320
How did you know?

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.320
As if your pig brain could come up with this.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.930
Go back and get some rest first.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.880
Boss.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.960
It's over.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.660
The innkeeper wouldn't really let me die, would he?

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.440
Take a good rest.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.480
Wait.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.200
Let me lean on you.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.300
Are you still feeling unwell?

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.159
I'm tired.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.080
This is Fengxin's favorite thing.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.400
Fengxin.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:14.800
Sister.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:15.920
Sister,

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.440
where are you?

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.440
I'm so scared,

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.080
Fengxin.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:20.880
Sister.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:22.400
Fengxin.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.080
Sister.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.280
Sister.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:39.760
Sister.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.320
What is this?

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.570
What have you prepared?

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.280
Sister.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.520
This is so beautiful,

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.800
I love it so much.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.520
Look, Sister.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.360
Fengxin.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:17.960
Fengxin.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:21.720
Fengxin,

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.760
I can't find you anymore.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:24.920
Fengxin.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.440
I'm sorry.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:35.720
Sister.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:36.840
Sister,

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.720
I have never blamed you.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.920
You need to be well

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.080
and live on.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:45.920
I'm sorry,

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.720
it's my fault for not protecting you.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.200
You're awake.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.210
Are you feeling better?

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:37.560
I'm hungry.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.970
Why are you wrapping so slowly?

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:52.920
You do it then.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.490
It's delicious.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.160
Aren't you eating?

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.160
Why are you grinning at me like that?

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:34.760
Boss.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.770
You're actually being understanding of others now.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.320
I'm not holding a grudge against Zhu Niaoniao.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.380
It's because I know she was being used

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.200
and is not the real culprit.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.160
Then who's behind her?

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.480
Dugu Qiongqi.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.320
Dugu Qiongqi.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.520
The one from a thousand years ago

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.920
who turned us against each other.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.960
What are you thinking about?

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:20.600
Don't worry.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.180
I'll take care of everything.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.080
Let's eat now.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.560
Qin Qi

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.400
Dugu Qiongqi

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:54.690
Dongfang

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.120
What brings you here?

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.640
We've been friends for so many years.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.240
Just came to see you.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.640
Do I need an appointment?

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.700
At least you still have a conscience.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.380
Have a seat.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.040
What would you like to drink?

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.900
You've been quite busy lately, haven't you?

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.490
I have been rather busy,

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.700
but since you're here, I'll make sure to treat you well.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.680
Busy using Zhu Niaoniao?

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:19.920
Dugu Qiongqi.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:33.490
What did you say?

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:34.560
Am I wrong?

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.170
What should I call you then?

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.320
Qin Qi?

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.320
Or Dugu Qiongqi?

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.200
Did you remember something?

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.060
Underestimating your enemy leads to disaster.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.500
It won't happen again.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.450
What are you talking about?

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.260
You really don't remember me?

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.770
You're the one in black who's been causing trouble, aren't you?

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.840
What exactly do you want?

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.280
So many years have passed.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.180
How do you have one too?

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.650
This is the Huangquan Pendant.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.680
In other words,

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:42.760
it is us.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.090
So you don't need to hate me.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.340
You think I would believe you?

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.880
There's only this much work every day.

00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.210
Why should I do more work

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.360
while you just sit here?

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.200
You don't do anything.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.160
I won't do it.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.250
Why should I?

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.600
You're already so fat.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.400
What's wrong with doing some work?

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.000
Who's fat?

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:06.480
You are.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:07.400
You are.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:07.880
Only you are fat.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:08.240
You're fat.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.570
You're definitely fat.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:10.920
Boss.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:11.480
Boss.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.880
Why are you dressed like a celebrity today?

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.360
The flatterer was right.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.560
But if I wore this outfit,

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.440
I'd look as beautiful as a goddess.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.360
Give me a break.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:23.760
How annoying.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.610
Where is Dongfang Zhaobai?

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:40.040
Sir.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.930
Mr. Dongfang left early this morning.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.040
He left?

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.840
Why didn't he tell me?
