00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.320
Madam Ling.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.180
What's wrong with the innkeeper?

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.000
This is...

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.160
Innkeeper.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.120
Feiye.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.880
Take care.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.520
No demon has ever

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.780
escaped from my grasp, Shangguan Feiye.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.000
Fengxin.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.120
Fengxin.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.360
Fengxin.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.800
Fengxin.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.560
Fengxin.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.320
Fengxin.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.120
Wake up!

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.320
Fengxin.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.980
This is the innkeeper's past.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.200
It's me.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.600
Did I know her before?

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.680
That's right.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.000
You saved Feiye when she was dying.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.440
You brought her back to the inn

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.900
and took great care of her.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.920
So beautiful.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.280
You once shared a wonderful time together.

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.140
Unfortunately, it didn't last long.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.440
She killed me with her own hands.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.080
I was the one who saved Feiye.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.740
I am the real owner of this inn.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.170
You saw everything.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.600
So when you first met me,

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.860
you already knew who I was.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.800
What about Shangguan Feiye?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.060
Why did she find me?

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.340
Does she want to kill me again?

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.400
What do you feel?

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.880
Will she hurt you again

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.210
like she did before?

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.040
I don't know.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.320
Is what your eyes see

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.800
necessarily the truth?

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.760
Sometimes certain things

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.400
need to be felt with your heart.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.260
What are you doing?

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.260
I know everything now.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:54.610
Oh my!

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.400
That's great.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.280
The shopkeeper has finally found love.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.280
Nonsense.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.520
The shopkeeper has lived for a thousand years.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.040
And now blooming like an iron tree for this intern.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.600
No way.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.240
Look.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.120
For a thousand years,

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.200
you've been going through all this.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.520
It's fine.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.930
I'm used to it by now.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.720
What's wrong?

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.860
Are you scared?

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.120
You were the bride who killed me.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.050
So you know everything.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.720
Yes, it was me.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:56.760
So what?

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.300
Do you regret staying?

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.010
Or are you afraid

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.320
that I'll kill you again

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.930
like I did a thousand years ago?

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:08.600
Feiye.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.740
Why do you always push me away?

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.320
Didn't you always want to leave?

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.420
Dongfang Zhaobai.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.900
Today I'm giving you a chance.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:32.960
Go.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.000
This is your last chance.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.440
Leave now.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.240
While I still have patience.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.400
I thought you left.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.220
Who said I left?

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.560
I've decided to stay at the inn.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.490
To stay with you.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.940
Aren't you afraid I'll use you again?

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.880
Then keep using me.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.000
Just don't throw me away.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.320
Otherwise...

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.120
I'll tell

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.640
everyone at the inn

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.280
about the customer complaints.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.080
You dare threaten me,

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.320
you rookie?

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.520
In front of me, the former innkeeper,

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.780
who's the rookie here?

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.140
Innkeeper,

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.680
can I ask you something serious?

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.360
The matter with the Frost Demon

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.220
has been successfully resolved.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.020
Since that obsession is gone,

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.540
why did Mei Jiulang

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.650
suddenly attack you back then?

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.240
Everything

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.560
might be related to that person from a thousand years ago.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.120
A thousand years ago?

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:30.880
It's nothing.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.170
I hope I'm overthinking it.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.250
Don't worry.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.600
Mr. Dongfang.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:41.480
Oh my!

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.730
You and our manager are just

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:44.520
a perfect match,

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.120
made in heaven,

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.280
a match made for each other.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.040
The newcomer

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.100
is already sucking up to the manager.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.520
There's nothing between me and the manager.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.120
Please don't spread rumors.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.280
Then why is the manager treating you so specially?

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.140
Yeah, exactly.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.280
After all, I was once

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.410
the former manager of the Monster Inn.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:09.720
What?

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.760
You were the former manager?

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:15.320
Uh...

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:16.680
Mr. Dongfang,

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.760
you've remembered everything?

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.490
I've heard a little bit.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.340
What happened to all of you a thousand years ago?

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.040
Why did the innkeeper want to kill me?

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:28.960
When I came to the inn,

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.440
you had already been dealt with by the innkeeper.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.000
By that time, the inn was already

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.920
under the innkeeper's management.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:35.600
Haha!

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:40.500
As for me...

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.880
I arrived later than that bootlicker,

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:43.940
so I know even less.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.240
Besides, I've been staying at this Monster Inn

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.480
just waiting for the innkeeper

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.800
to break the curse

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:50.800
and vanish into thin air,

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:51.920
so I can inherit this business.

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:52.250
Oh my,

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.480
you shouldn't say that!

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.680
Vanish into thin air?

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.210
Isn't the innkeeper immortal?

00:12:59.160 --> 00:12:59.760
Dongfang,

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.440
we've only heard rumors.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.600
The innkeeper, because of a curse,

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.760
has been trapped in this Monster Inn for a thousand years.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:07.680
If by chance,

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.280
once the curse is broken,

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.880
the innkeeper will...

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:11.810
What do you mean?

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.020
What curse?

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.480
I really don't know.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.920
I was just making it up.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.680
Please don't slip up and tell the manager.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:19.160
Right.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.920
We just accidentally

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.840
overheard the conversation between the medium and the manager.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.720
What if this curse isn't real?

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.320
What if it's just a legend?

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:26.720
Right?

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.600
Haha.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.330
This is impossible.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.280
Mr. Dongfang.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.080
Mr. Dongfang.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.000
It's over.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:34.640
It's over.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.080
It's all your fault for talking too much.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.360
I didn't do it on purpose.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.020
Well, I did it on purpose then.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:40.800
Oh my!

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:47.480
Ling Po.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.850
I have something to ask you.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.600
Manager Dongfang.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:53.800
I didn't expect

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.680
we would meet again so soon.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.360
Why was Shangguan Feiye cursed?

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.280
Why is she burned by karmic fire?

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:01.960
After the curse is lifted,

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.020
will she really vanish into thin air?

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.440
So you've heard everything.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.440
So all of this is true.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.280
Not entirely.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:14.880
Ling Po,

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.810
please tell me everything.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:19.920
Shangguan

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.560
was indeed cursed.

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:24.480
That's how she became the owner of the Monster Inn.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.480
Ageless and immortal.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.320
But she's trapped in the Monster Inn

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.000
because of the mistakes she made in the past.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:35.880
A thousand years ago,

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.480
Shangguan Feiye

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.080
was the strongest monster hunter in the world.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.540
She made it her mission to kill all monsters.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.560
Regardless of whether they were good or evil,

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:46.690
she killed them all.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.960
Eventually, because of her excessive killing,

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.600
the resentment of the monsters she killed backfired on her,

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.880
cursing her.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.840
Every so often, she's burned by karmic fire.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.450
The pain is unbearable.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:02.930
At the same time,

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.160
the curse also made her someone who could

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.220
resolve the obsessions of her guests as the innkeeper.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.210
This is how she atones for her sins.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.320
Being the innkeeper, for her,

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:15.080
is both a curse

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.160
and also a form of protection.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.860
So after all these obsessions are resolved,

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.880
will she really vanish into thin air?
