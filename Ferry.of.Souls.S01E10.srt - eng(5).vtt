00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.080
My mom is very good to me

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.340
and loves me very much.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.900
She loves me so much

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.520
that it suffocates me.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.640
Haitang.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.530
Where have you been?

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.580
Do you know what time it is?

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.889
Today is your birthday.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.360
Mom has prepared a table full of delicious food

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.560
just waiting for you.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.440
Today

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.079
my friends celebrated my birthday with me.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.920
I've already eaten outside.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.400
But I didn't eat much.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.050
I'll wash my hands and eat right away, Mom.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.000
This time since it's your birthday,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.800
I'll let it go.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.840
But in the future,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.960
you absolutely cannot eat that junk food outside.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.280
Since you were little,

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.360
everything Mom has prepared for you

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.090
has been nutritionally balanced, healthy food.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.650
This way,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.280
you can have a healthy body.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.680
Go now.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.600
Why are you in such a hurry?

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.880
I'm putting my backpack in the bedroom.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.920
I'll be right out.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.240
Wait a minute.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.160
Well, well, Zou Haitang.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.440
You've grown up now.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.240
Think you're independent, huh?

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.400
Who gave you this?

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.760
Which bad boy was it?

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.100
It's not like that.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.400
This is from my good friend.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.570
She said I've graduated from high school.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.000
And should look more like a young woman now.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.800
I'm grown up now.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.720
It's time for college.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.360
No matter how old you get,

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.940
you'll always be my child.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.970
Dinner's ready.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.720
Time to eat.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.400
After dinner,

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.410
throw those shoes away.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.760
And that friend who gave you those shoes,

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.090
don't see them anymore.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.340
They'll be a bad influence on you.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.640
You have your mother.

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:43.240
Mom is your best friend.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.140
What are you doing?

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.280
She's crazy.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.680
With a mother like that,

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.920
no wonder you once...

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.680
Once?

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.200
Boss,

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.900
do you know something?

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.540
There's no point talking about this now.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.000
If I hadn't found Qin Qi's therapy center that day,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.800
I wouldn't have made it this far.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.560
Combo set.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.440
Thank you for setting it up.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.440
Combo set.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.520
Aren't you afraid I might be crazy?

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.890
Emotions need an outlet for release and expression.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.620
You must be carrying too much inside.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.260
That's why you choose food

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.100
to fill the emptiness within.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.280
All this time,

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.320
you've been struggling so much.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.290
No one has ever said something like that to me before.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.640
What do you do?

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.160
I'm a therapist.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.330
If you ever want to talk.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.410
Remember to come see me.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.820
Take care of yourself.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.120
But

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.360
I really can't face Mr. Qin again.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.840
Something's wrong!

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:52.960
Boss!

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.960
There's a lady outside

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.640
who claims to be the victim's mother.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.360
She's accusing our inn of kidnapping her daughter.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.160
She's making a scene in the lobby

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.040
and breaking things.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.300
Please go check it out.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.640
I really don't want to go home and face my mother.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:05.520
I'm begging you

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.160
to help me.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.040
How did she get here?

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.480
It seems this time we have

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.170
more than one guest.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.520
Zou Haitang.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.840
Running away isn't the solution.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.770
You'll have to face it eventually.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.560
Haitang.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:29.920
Zou Haitang.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.720
Zou Haitang.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.720
Innkeeper,

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:35.200
we've already packed everything

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.929
and now this crazy woman has...

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:42.490
Hurry up and bring my daughter out!

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:44.440
Zou Haitang is an adult.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.100
She can go wherever she wants.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.720
She doesn't want to come home.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.400
She doesn't want to see you.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.860
You're talking nonsense.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.480
My daughter is the most obedient and sensible girl.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.880
It must be people like you

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.740
who corrupted her.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.130
Haitang!

00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.250
Zou Haitang!

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.680
Zou Haitang!

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.370
Stop shouting. I've brought her back.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:05.560
Let go of me!

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.620
What are you doing?

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.570
Zou Haitang!

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.060
Staying out all night.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.060
You're going to be the death of me.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.610
Good thing I set up location tracking for you on my phone.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.200
Why?

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.920
Why won't you give me

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.580
even a little bit of your time?

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.660
Since you were little,

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:27.920
whatever you wanted,

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.360
I always made it happen.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.680
I'm really going to lose my mind.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.540
Are you trying to drive me to my grave?

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.560
I am your mother.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.800
I've suffered for 20 years.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.560
Do you think it was easy raising you?

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.480
I just wanted to be somewhere

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.320
where you couldn't see me, to have some peace.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.000
Just to catch my breath.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.400
Come home with me.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:19.480
Haitang.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:21.600
Haitang.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.120
Haitang.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.360
Haitang.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.080
I'm begging you.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.400
Don't hurt her.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.080
I'll do anything.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.490
Just don't hurt her.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:47.840
Haitang.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.280
Haitang.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.520
Haitang.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.320
Love is the deepest emotion in the world,

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.920
yet it hurts the most.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.420
Finally some peace and quiet.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.680
We haven't even started,

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.120
and I'm already exhausted.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:19.920
It's all your fault

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.880
for bringing back this troublemaker.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.280
When all is said and done,

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.140
you brought this on yourself.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.120
A thousand years ago,

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.520
you acted recklessly.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:29.760
Now

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.320
it's time to pay for your sins.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.560
You killed the mother and daughter, didn't you?

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.760
Don't talk nonsense.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.760
Then why do you keep refusing this case?

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.840
If we complete this case,

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.720
we might be able to extinguish the karmic flames.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.480
Who told Zou Haitang to eat whatever she wants?

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:47.880
She ate

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.240
the wonton noodles you made.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.340
Just because of a bowl of noodles?

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.250
You're jealous.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:04.490
Shangguan Feiye

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:05.890
has never been jealous.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.200
Now get out of here.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:07.860
And you two,

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:08.410
take them

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.540
to the guest rooms.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.440
Yes, boss.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:15.800
You are jealous.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.720
Me? Jealous?

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.010
That's ridiculous.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.480
It's all your fault for talking too much,

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.410
telling him about the karmic fire.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.000
By the way,

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:31.880
I think

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.320
I saw Dugu Qiongqi again.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.250
Perhaps he never disappeared.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:44.520
He might even

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.400
be hiding among us.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.000
You

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.340
are the one who needs to let go of your obsession.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:56.620
It's time to leave.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.440
Let's go resolve Zou Haitang's obsession.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:33.340
Come over here.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:38.700
Put it here.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.380
Go up there.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.860
Set it up properly.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.680
Is this spot okay?

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.130
Higher, higher.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.160
It's aligned now.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.880
Why is this place so strange?

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.160
Is this really where we're supposed to be?

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.160
This should be it.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.570
This is Zou Haitang's home.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.360
Jin Xiu Lou,

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.560
Lou Xiu Jin,

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:18.640
a Zou family daughter starved to death,

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.680
the master cries,

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.640
the master laughs,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
the coffin turns into a bridal sedan.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.040
What are they talking about?

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.800
What's all this about Jin Xiu Lou, coffins and bridal sedans?

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.400
The Jin Xiu Lou they're talking about

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.200
is right here in the Zou mansion.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.120
They say Zou Haitang's father spent a fortune

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.060
to build it specially for her.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:40.240
This story became quite famous throughout the city.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.900
What exactly happened to Zou Haitang back then?

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.620
Could it be related to you?

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.200
Back then,

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.000
I killed her.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:43.080
Help!

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:43.800
Run!

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.840
When I rushed here to hunt down the man-eating demon,

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.960
Zou's mother had already been devoured by her.

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:08.560
In the end,

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.050
I only managed to save Master Zou from the demon's mouth.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.040
Kids,

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.000
the Jinxiu Tower you just mentioned...

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:20.760
But this family...

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.760
Yes, indeed.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.440
What exactly happened to this family?

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.320
Why are there both red and white lanterns?

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.040
How can you know nothing about this?

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.320
Mrs. Zou has died.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.920
Miss Zou is getting married.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.060
That's why they hung lanterns of two different colors.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:37.400
Hey, kid.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.120
Are there any rumors about demons in the city lately?

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:43.040
Adults say there's a man-eating demon in the city.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.520
So nobody dares to go out these days.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:46.840
Gou Dan! Xiao Hua!

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:47.320
Oh.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.480
You little brats!

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.640
You've had me searching everywhere.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:50.600
Hurry home now!

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.080
If the man-eating demon catches you,

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.540
I won't be able to save you.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.000
The man-eating demon that woman mentioned,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.330
could it be Zou Haitang?

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:00.780
It probably is.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.800
When I arrived at the Zou residence back then,

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.560
Zou Haitang had already become a demon.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.640
As for why she turned into a demon,

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.359
and what happened before that,

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:08.420
I'm not quite sure.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.760
How are we going to sneak in there?

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:13.760
Just like before,

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.480
we'll disguise ourselves.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.400
Pretend to be a couple again?

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.079
Dream on.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.010
Let's go.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:19.800
Where are you taking me?

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:20.880
I just remembered someone

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.339
who might know something.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.079
You have friends here too?

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:26.810
This person,

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:27.880
you know them too.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.480
Why is he alone here?

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.080
Where is everyone else?

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.480
Isn't he afraid of being eaten by the man-eating demons?

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.760
What if he's not human?

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:38.880
He's a demon?
