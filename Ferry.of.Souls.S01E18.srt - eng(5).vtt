00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.600
Now that you've accepted the gifts

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.200
and your anger has subsided,

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.440
let's go to the lantern festival together.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.720
What lantern festival?

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.000
Today is the Qixi lantern festival.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
It's very lively.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.840
I've lived for a thousand years and seen everything.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.370
Why should I join the crowd?

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.560
Boss.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.780
I've been working for you for so long now.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.000
Come with me to the lantern festival.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.480
Consider it an employee benefit.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.340
What do you say?

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.000
And you can wear your beautiful fairy dress to the festival.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.060
It would be perfect for the occasion.

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:18.280
That does make sense.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.220
Look how amazing he is.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.770
It's beautiful.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.440
This suits you so well.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.900
Really?

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.410
This one is nice.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.460
Let's check out what's ahead.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.850
Boss, do you have anything better?

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.970
Take it, take it.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.250
Thank you, boss.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.720
Let's go look over there.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.680
Hey, sir!

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.440
Your wife looks like a fairy descended from heaven.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.770
How about a sky lantern?

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.920
We're not.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.640
We'll take it.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.180
Thank you, sir.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.460
Innkeeper.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.640
What did you wish for?

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.570
I'm not telling you.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.800
We've known each other for so long.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.930
Don't be so distant.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.240
This is my secret.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.280
Do you want to know what I wished for?

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.410
I don't want to know.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.240
Oh, why not?

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.040
If you tell, it won't come true.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.680
Silly.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.140
Over there.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.480
So many! They're beautiful.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.410
Look at that one.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.810
Wow, that one's so high!

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.060
It's so beautiful.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.159
I wish

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.090
time could stop at this moment.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.920
Boss.

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.880
Your wish

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.530
will definitely come true.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.680
Of course.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.220
The Qixi Festival is quite lively today.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.840
With all the drums and gongs.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.560
No, that's not it.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.920
It's the gift-giving procession about to depart.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.360
Take a look!

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.640
Come and see!

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.800
One more!

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.480
Alright!

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.640
Make way, please!

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.300
Where's the gift procession?

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.640
Come on, make way!

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.860
Please step aside!

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.650
Your old acquaintance is here.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.660
Look at what's behind her.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.280
It must be priceless.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.540
Wow, how magnificent!

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.500
This is the Huoshu Yinhua.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.680
Truly a priceless treasure.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.560
Such an important treasure

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.890
with only four escorts?

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.520
What if it gets hijacked?

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.800
These are the four most renowned masters of our time.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.320
Each one has exceptional skills.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.520
In critical moments,

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.760
these four can match four entire teams.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.320
Then why back then

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.000
did the gift still fail to be delivered?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.130
Internal conflict.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.810
Internal conflict?

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.050
Back then...

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.720
The theft of the Fire Tree Silver Flower

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.780
shocked both human and demon realms.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.080
The four masters Liu, Li, Chen, and Wu were renowned throughout the land.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.280
The four were ordered to escort the treasure out of the city,

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.810
and everyone believed it would be foolproof.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.800
Liu Yiyi and Li Wubai

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.440
were disciples from the same school.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.680
Childhood sweethearts

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.409
deeply in love with each other.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.540
Who would have thought

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.720
that something would suddenly go wrong on their journey?

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.520
Someone planned to steal what they were guarding.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.580
What are you doing?

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.520
Liu,

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.420
humans and demons now live together.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.580
The demons are growing stronger.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.370
Who knows what might happen in the future.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.240
We're all just trying to secure our own future.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.360
You're after the Fire Blossom.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.010
The Fire Blossom is priceless.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.760
With it, we'll never worry about anything again.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.919
Stealing what you're meant to protect.

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:37.159
I can't believe you'd stoop so low.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.120
Hahaha.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.799
Low?

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.860
When it comes to survival,

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.120
there's no such thing as stooping low.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.920
Don't be so self-righteous.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.440
Be careful risking your life for others.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.300
You might end up suffering for it.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.280
Where is Li Wubai?

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.440
What have you done to him?

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.960
Hahaha.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.200
Finally remembered your lover?

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.280
Li Wubai.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.720
Hahaha.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.600
So,

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.320
are you surprised?

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.660
Why are you pointing your sword at me?

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:27.960
Yiyi.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.170
Chen Jiang, Wu Hu and I have already agreed

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.080
to take the Hushu Yinhua.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.560
We'll be living like kings.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.080
You're actually conspiring with them.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.200
Li Wubai.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.500
Have you ever thought that

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.200
the Hushu Yinhua

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.720
is meant to save many lives?

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.840
How could you do something so unconscionable?

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.920
Li Wubai was right.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.320
He knew you would be so stubborn.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.040
Better to deal with you right here

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.560
to eliminate future trouble.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.560
Li Wubai.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.940
You've betrayed your word

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.360
and joined with these two

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.490
to commit acts that betray all people.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:08.960
Heaven will punish you for this.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:09.440
Yiyi.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.040
I'm sorry.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.360
Hushu Yinhua.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.160
Finally in our hands.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.730
From now on, we brothers

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.160
will live the good life.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.400
What's happening?

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.200
Hushu Yinhua.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:25.680
Hushu Yinhua.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.240
My treasure.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.850
What happened next?

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.180
The next news came three years later.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.960
Liu Yiyi cultivated herself into a demon

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.320
and built a mansion

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.570
on Yuhu Mountain outside the city.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:44.960
They say

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.530
in just three years,

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.130
she collected countless rare treasures.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.800
Reborn as a rich lady.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.480
She spread rumors everywhere

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.650
that Hushu Yinhua had reappeared.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.600
This attracted countless people to Yuhu Mansion

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.960
who wanted to see this legendary treasure with their own eyes.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.490
Those three went there too?

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.240
Back then, those three were afraid of being held responsible,

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.040
so they framed Liu Yiyi

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.480
for the theft of Hushu Yinhua.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.700
That's so inhuman.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.480
After Liu Yiyi lured the three of them to the mansion,

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.080
she killed Chen Jiang and Wu Hu that very night.

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.690
What about Li Wubai?

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.770
I happened to be traveling by at that time,

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.080
and killed Liu Yiyi at the height of her demonic power,

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.120
saving Li Wubai.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:32.720
Why does it sound like

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.650
Liu Yiyi was the one doing justice?

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.540
That's true in principle,

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.280
but the demonic power within her

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.680
was completely beyond her control.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:40.520
Once out of control,

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.520
she would have killed many more innocent people.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.980
So a thousand years later,

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.210
Liu Yiyi tried everything to bring down Li Wubai.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.240
I suppose so.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.080
Wait, that's not right.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.200
No, no, no.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:56.360
What's wrong?

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.720
After these few times,

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.040
I've found that the truth and your memories

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.440
don't completely match.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.520
I think the story you told

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.840
is still questionable.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:08.770
What do you mean?

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:09.930
You're doubting me?

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.360
I'm just raising reasonable questions.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.360
Believe it or not,

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.120
if you're so capable, don't follow me.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.980
I'd rather investigate on my own.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.930
Then I won't have to save you when there's danger.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.360
Why are you getting angry?

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.000
Hey, boss.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.160
Boss, don't be angry.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.440
Don't stand so close to me.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.600
We're just employer and employee.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.700
But I'm still your person.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.400
Smooth talker.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.620
We haven't eaten the chicken yet.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.480
What are they eating?

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.240
Poison pills.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.160
Do you know your words are very cutting?

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:55.760
I know.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.240
So what do we do next?

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.120
Infiltrate their group.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.000
How do we do that?
