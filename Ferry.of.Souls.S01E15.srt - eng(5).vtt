00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.920
There are thick calluses on his fingertips.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.120
Could he be a gambler?

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.720
Please let me in, young man.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.320
This time,

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.600
I'm sure I can turn the tables.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.880
Get lost!

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.120
You still haven't paid back

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.400
the money you borrowed from our gambling house.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.720
I'll give you three more days.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.680
If you don't pay up,

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.740
we'll take your daughter as payment.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.960
Now scram!

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.880
Young master!

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.740
Please come in,

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.840
we have all kinds of entertainment inside.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.840
Please, this way.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.460
Get out of here!

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.480
Let's follow and see.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.600
This place is full of all sorts of people.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.660
I'll take the lead.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.360
Hurry up!

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.120
Place your bets!

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.480
This luck is killing me!

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.200
Ah, good!

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.400
So,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.660
want to try a round?

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.440
You know how to do this?

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.079
What did you think?

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:58.680
How else would I have spent

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.600
my thousand years of boredom?

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.800
This is interesting.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.240
Let's go.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.760
Impressive, innkeeper.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.920
Honored guests,

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.520
the Silver Room is upstairs.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.329
What does Silver Room mean?

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.000
It's where they receive VIP customers.

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.610
This is our deputy manager.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.720
Esteemed guests,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.320
you were quite impressive downstairs,

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.440
making quite a scene.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.260
So you're the innkeeper here?

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.320
To be precise, I'm the second manager.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.250
Where is your head manager?

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.280
Tell me the truth.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.600
Otherwise I might not control my strength.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.200
This brush

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.460
will come down.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.560
Please calm down.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.520
I swear

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.399
I'm not lying.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.160
Our manager passed away three months ago.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.760
This gambling house is running normally.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.480
You're saying

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.240
the manager is dead?

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.200
Exactly.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.290
Who would believe that?

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.800
I swear.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.720
If I tell a single lie,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.460
may I die a terrible death.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.200
A terrible death.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Three months ago,

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.960
the manager said he wanted to remarry.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.680
He went back to his hometown for the wedding

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.930
and never returned.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.530
And then?

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.760
The messenger who came back said

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.400
on the wedding night,

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.850
he was found dead in bed,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.840
before dawn.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.000
So he just abandoned such a big gambling house?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.400
I'm puzzled too.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.160
Our manager used to be obsessed with money.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.600
To keep this gambling house running,

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.320
he often bribed Mr. Zhao from the county office.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.200
But to remarry,

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.000
he gave up his business.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.400
Mr. Zhao?

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.680
What?

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.210
You said Clerk Zhao is dead?

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.600
When did this happen?

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.400
Just two months ago.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.320
He kept a mistress in the south of the city.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.650
A few days later, he died in her courtyard.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.159
It's about a woman again.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.170
Do you know what this mistress looks like?

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.060
I caught a glimpse of her once.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.880
Oval face.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.200
Big eyes.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.240
Fair skin.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.770
And quite young.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.240
Could it be her?

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.560
Who?

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:07.160
No.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.090
It's her.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.920
Who is it?

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.140
Innkeeper?

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.600
Thank you.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.860
Innkeeper.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.080
Zhu Niaoniao.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.690
I don't know you.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.090
Get away from me.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.960
For Yun Niang's sake,

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.280
you've suffered a lot, haven't you?

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.760
Scholar Yang,

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.240
the gambling house manager,

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.490
and Secretary Zhao -

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.690
they all died because of Yun Niang, right?

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.770
What exactly happened?

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.290
Don't worry,

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.900
we're here to help you.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.360
At first...

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.200
Hey!

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.960
I've been waiting forever,

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.160
why are you so late?

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:25.400
Ma'am,

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:26.440
I'm sorry,

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.090
I was delayed on the way.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.960
Didn't we agree on three pigs?

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.040
Why is one missing?

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.320
You must have miscounted.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.280
There are three right here.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.400
Don't try to fool me.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.040
Let me tell you,

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.500
I don't want the small one.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.560
What a cute little pig!

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.060
Look at how small and chubby it is,

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.240
how adorable!

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.600
It's a good omen.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.160
Why don't we keep it

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.410
and raise it at home?

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.640
Oh, daughter,

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.360
our family butchers pigs,

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.680
we don't raise them.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.360
Little pig.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.490
Don't be afraid.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.200
I won't let them kill you.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.560
Please let me keep it.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.360
Fine.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.840
I'll take this small one too,

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.780
but you have to give me a discount.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.460
Sure thing.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.620
Thank you, Mother.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.770
This silly girl.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:33.780
Be good now.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.520
Who are you?

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.200
Sister, I'm your little pig.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.200
What's wrong?

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:51.680
Nothing.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.680
You're so jumpy.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.890
What did you say?

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.360
You're my little pig?

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:01.880
Sister,

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.200
Sister,

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.290
don't be afraid.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.320
You saved my life.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.960
I would never hurt you.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.220
You really are the little pig?

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:29.800
Look at you,

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.010
keeping a pig at home was one thing,

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.160
but now you're bringing home a girl?

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.920
This girl is in real trouble.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.400
She's pitiful.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.880
Let's help her.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:48.920
You

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.760
are just too kind-hearted.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.370
Isn't that because you raised me well?

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.800
We don't keep idle people in the Zhu family.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.530
Can you work?

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.480
I can wash clothes, chop wood, cook,

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.400
and also

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.520
feed pigs.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.240
Alright then.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.570
You can stay for now.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:18.760
[Coughs]

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.250
Sister, let me do it.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.370
Hey, sister.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:25.460
Let me do it.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.560
You must be tired.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.320
You stupid girl!

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.080
Zhiyuan and I truly love each other.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.020
Why can't you just give us your blessing?

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:51.760
Oh my!

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.280
I've seen many men in my life.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.560
That Scholar Yang

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.040
is not a good person at all.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.820
He's slick and insincere.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.160
He's not worthy of you.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.530
It's not like that, Mother.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.760
Zhiyuan is a scholar.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.760
It's I who am not worthy of him.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.520
You're such a fool.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.560
This marriage

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.440
I will never approve of it.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:16.640
Get up now.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.360
What if I insist on marrying him?

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.200
Then don't consider me your mother anymore.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.040
You're on your own.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.040
And you.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.420
Go back to wherever you came from.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:52.320
Sister.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.460
You wretched girl!

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.120
If you dare step out that door today,

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.740
I am no longer your mother.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.020
I'm an unfilial daughter.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:52.600
Sister.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.410
Please take care of Mother.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.080
Wait.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:55.920
Take this.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.140
Don't suffer needlessly.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:28.320
Open up!

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.370
Is anyone there?

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.180
Open the door quickly!

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:34.480
Yunniang.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:35.880
Yunniang is gone.
