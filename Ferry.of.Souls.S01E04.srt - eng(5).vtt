00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.289
Tickets are hard to get.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.810
It'll be tough for us to sneak in today.

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.080
Nonsense.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.920
I, Shangguan Feiye, can go wherever I want.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.690
Let's go.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.660
Can't you fly anymore?

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.080
My spiritual powers suddenly stopped working.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.080
Is that a problem?

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.800
Oh no!

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.000
Then we came here for nothing.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.730
What do you mean 'for nothing'?

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.020
As my subordinate,

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.200
you need to solve this problem

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.720
right now.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.760
I can't fly either.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.440
Useless.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.490
This useless person thinks

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.880
we don't necessarily have to fly in.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.560
Look at this fabric.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.600
How sturdy it is!

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.800
Don't you think?

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.660
Yes, it's nice.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.770
Let me check over there.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.280
What?

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.130
Let's go.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.720
Wonton noodles.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.640
Sir.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.080
Customer.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.080
Two bowls of wonton noodles,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.920
one without green onions,

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.080
and one without chili.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.560
Coming right up!

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.890
Please have a seat, sir.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.840
This way, please.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.240
So this is your brilliant plan?

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.280
First, leisurely shopping,

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.940
and then eating noodles here?

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.640
Well,

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.440
it's mealtime now,

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.900
so eating is the priority.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.480
Since we've come all this way,

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.760
we should definitely try these pure,

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.360
additive-free delicacies.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.920
I don't have time to sit here eating with you.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.160
If you can't think of a solution,

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.620
I'll figure it out myself.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.820
The best is yet to come.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.640
After we finish eating, I'll tell you my plan.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.079
Okay?

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.800
Hurry up.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.400
This wonton noodle soup

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.400
should be enjoyed by two people together

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.860
to truly savor its flavor.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.400
I never expected the famous Dongfang Zhaobai

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.200
would actually cook by himself.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.240
Cough cough.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.480
Is it that bad?

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.980
It's quite delicious,

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.160
just a bit...

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.080
You like wonton noodles

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.140
but not spicy food.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.700
Dongfang Zhaobai,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.960
are you secretly keeping track of my preferences?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.240
Don't talk while eating.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.700
Are you going to eat or not?

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.980
Have this bowl.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.380
You should eat too.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.800
Wonton noodles should definitely be enjoyed by two people together

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.530
to truly appreciate the taste.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.180
Try it quickly.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.960
Don't talk while eating.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.520
I wasn't talking.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.560
Why aren't you eating?

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.090
I'm full.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:31.740
That was quick.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.040
I'm done.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.050
Now let's talk about your plan.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.580
Be careful.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.610
Watch your step.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.540
So this is your method?

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.400
I've already figured everything out.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.040
The garden is hosting a big feast today and they're short-handed.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.560
They've hired extra help from outside.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.680
A couple buying vegetables could easily slip in.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.680
No one would notice.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.940
Who said I'm your wife?

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.980
Then father and daughter.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.440
Take this.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.700
Be careful.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.400
Hey!

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.770
What are you doing here?

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.560
We're here to deliver vegetables.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.960
Delivering vegetables?

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.480
Why do you look so familiar?

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:45.880
Sir,

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.120
Whenever there's a show here,

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.440
we always come to deliver vegetables.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.970
That's why I look familiar.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.200
Who is she?

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.680
My wife.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.360
Your wife?

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.400
My spouse.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.760
You've been working so hard lately, my dear.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.890
You've lost weight.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.160
As long as you and our child can have a good life,

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.160
I'm willing to endure any hardship.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.560
Alright, alright.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.040
Stop being so lovey-dovey.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:24.960
Get inside quickly.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.240
Come right back out after you drop it off.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.000
Don't offend the distinguished guests.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.860
Yes, of course.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.380
Innkeeper,

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.440
your acting skills are quite impressive.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.080
Likewise.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.220
Stop hitting me, senior brother.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.060
I was wrong.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.400
Senior brother,

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.730
I really didn't mean to.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.400
What kind of trash

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.600
do you dare give me to use?

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:05.600
Senior brother,

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.530
when I got to Yunzhi House, they were already closed.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.240
But these days,

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.960
your throat isn't well.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:14.480
Why don't

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.800
I perform tonight's show

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.800
in your place?

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.640
So that's what you're after.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.760
Senior brother!

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:33.919
Please don't!

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:34.970
Senior brother!

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:35.929
Senior brother!

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.360
It's okay.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.700
It doesn't matter.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.220
As long as I can stay in the garden,

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.080
someday,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.680
eventually,

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.680
I will definitely perform on stage.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.720
Let's follow and see.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:46.940
Where is everyone?

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.200
I'm hungry again.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.610
Mind your own business.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.000
Wait a moment.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.860
So you can cook too?

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:21.640
Let me show you

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.800
the skills of a culinary master.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.360
I may not be able to fly

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.080
or fight,

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.920
but when it comes to cooking,

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.180
I'm naturally gifted.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.140
Innkeeper!

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:38.860
Innkeeper!

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.130
Fengxin!

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.200
Fengxin!

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.400
Fengxin!

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.160
Fengxin!

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.000
Fengxin!

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.680
Fengxin!

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.360
Wake up!

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:52.520
Feiye!

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:53.800
Feiye!

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.010
Innkeeper, wake up!

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:57.080
Innkeeper!

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.240
Innkeeper, are you alright?

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.580
There's something wrong with the water.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:11.960
Excuse me.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.200
It's you.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.080
We're here to deliver vegetables.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.080
We were passing by

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.120
and got terribly hungry,

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.800
so we made some food.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.040
Young man,

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.600
would you like to join us?

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.360
Is that okay?

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.440
Of course.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.120
By the way,

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.610
I forgot to tell you.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.200
You can call me

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.320
Su Huasheng.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:51.720
Su Huasheng.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.130
Have you been training here since childhood?

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.320
All apprentices here are orphans.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:00.960
I was five years old

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.940
when our troupe master took me in.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.800
I do odd jobs and learn skills in the theater

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.400
just to get by.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.130
What about Mei Jiulang?

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.340
He's a star performer now.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.440
The entire Ruichun Theater

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.300
depends on Master Mei to survive.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.800
Haven't you ever thought about performing on stage

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.530
and becoming someone like him?

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.880
I don't have that talent.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.140
I just empty chamber pots,

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.680
run errands and make deliveries,

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:32.840
just to earn my keep.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:34.960
Is Mei Jiulang

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.440
good to you all?

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.440
He's my senior.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.740
He used to be nice to me.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.960
When I was too busy,

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.800
he would save food for me.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.240
However,

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.700
after becoming a star,

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.960
he changed.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.400
When he's happy, he gives us a few coins.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.060
When he's upset, he has the troupe master beat us

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.040
until he feels better.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.400
Don't just stare at me.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.260
Please eat too.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:43.440
Boss,

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.360
when you stabbed him with your sword back then,

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.820
you let him off too easily.

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:55.980
This is really delicious.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.200
I really hope you could stay and cook at the theater.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.930
They would definitely love your cooking skills.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.160
That's great.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.650
Would it be possible

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.720
for you to introduce us to the troupe master?

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.520
That's fine.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:09.560
However,

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.720
I don't have much influence.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.640
I'm not sure if he will agree.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.500
What are you doing?

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.120
Don't move.
