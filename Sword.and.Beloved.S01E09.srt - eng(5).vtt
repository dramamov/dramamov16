[Sword and Beloved]

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.630
[Episode 9]

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.360
Quan Jingting,

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.920
You've lost all your martial power.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.450
Are you ready to let the Dragon Sigh

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.880
enter your body

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.330
and penetrate your meridians?

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.330
Bring it on!

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.680
Don't forget your promise.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.360
When the right time comes,

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.290
you will push the Soldier

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.079
into eternal darkness.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.579
[Peach Village]

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.850
Young Master Fugui,

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.930
is this the Peach Village?

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.760
What a vibrant place.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.850
Wow!

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.110
Young Master Fugui, look!

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.410
Humans and demons

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.010
are getting along well here.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.850
This plumeless thistle demon
is growing flowers.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.000
Such a lovely fragrance.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.800
This man's nose
is bigger than a pig demon's.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.330
It's even an upturned nose.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:08.290
I'm here!

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.800
This turtle demon is drumming up business.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.400
Come here.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.570
So funny.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.050
Young Master Fugui, look!

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.210
This human lady

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.490
is even saying hi to a demon.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:19.240
Thanks!

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.590
Over there,
a silkworm demon is selling fabric.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:24.880
But the cloths she wove

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.160
aren't as pretty as mine.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.690
Young Master Fugui,
what a bustling village this is.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.880
Humans don't fear demons,
and the latter wouldn't hurt the former.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.770
In this beautiful place,

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:32.770
they live in harmony with each other.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.170
What a great atmosphere.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:39.490
Fugui!

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:40.290
"Fugui"?

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.070
I'm calling your name, Fugui!

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.660
She seems to be calling you.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.010
You naughty rascal,

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.770
how dare you run away?

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:46.800
"Naughty rascal"?

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.600
Stop running!

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.320
Then I don't think she means you.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.640
Where is Fugui?

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.630
I know what she is looking for.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.850
Your duckling Fugui is here!

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.650
Here you are.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:11.730
Fugui...

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.340
Are you a raccoon dog demon?

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.640
Yes.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.920
Anything wrong with that?

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.370
This is the Peach Village.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.029
There are all kinds of demons.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.130
Is Zhang Qi here?

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.520
Please take me to him.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.010
Mr. Zhang isn't home in recent days.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.100
What do you want to meet him for?

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.720
For an issue, of course.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.580
We can't be here

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.380
to catch Fugui for you, right?

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:38.480
I won't divulge

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.600
any information about Mr. Zhang

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.000
until you tell me
the purpose of your visit.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.690
Fine.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.600
Now that you wouldn't say anything,

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.200
I might as well go ask others.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.730
Come back!

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.220
I'll take you to Mr. Zhang's abode.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.850
Follow me.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.190
Let's go, Young Master Fugui.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.410
Little raccoon dog demon.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.270
Do all your ducklings have names?

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:05.810
My name is Jiu.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.130
This is Fugui. This one is Ronghua.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.730
This is Jinyi. That is Yushi.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:10.880
Fugui

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.540
is the most rebellious of all.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.000
The noisiest, too.
It squawks all day long.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:16.720
Fugui?

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.570
Yeah.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:18.210
Fugui.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.880
This is Mr. Zhang's home.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.510
Granny Shui, we're having guests today!

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.970
Come on in.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.140
Granny Shui,

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.890
they're Mr. Zhang's guests.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.690
They want a meeting with him.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.970
Mr. Zhang has gone out.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.159
Take a rest, please.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.010
Sit down. Make yourselves at home.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.440
Okay.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.290
I told you so.

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.490
Mr. Zhang is not home.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.040
Why don't I make some tea for you?

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.409
Okay.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.520
Thank you.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.880
They...

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.370
All is fine. I'll deal with them.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.810
Okay.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:04.400
God knows

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.050
how they found this place.

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:07.200
Anyway,

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.370
I'd better knock them out first.

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:12.110
Here comes the tea!

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.490
These tea leaves
are treasured by Mr. Zhang.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:15.690
You're in luck.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:16.080
Okay.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:17.400
Thank you.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.970
They're named "Crab Legs."

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.840
Having absorbed the spiritual energy
of a one-thousand-year-old tea plant,

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.170
these tea leaves can truly

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:24.370
improve your health.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:27.370
Have a try.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:27.700
Sure.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.690
Thank you.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.280
Go ahead. Drink it.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.330
Young Master Fugui!

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.640
The tea... smells really good.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:56.980
Tasty, isn't it?

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:58.440
Yes.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.440
Have some snacks.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.130
Hmm...

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:02.830
This also tastes good.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.710
Little raccoon dog demon!

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:26.930
Do you really think

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.660
we'd be knocked out by some tea?

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.110
It's quite late. Where are you going?

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:32.570
I...

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.520
I'm not telling you!

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:44.520
I don't think

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.100
you guys can outrun me.

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:52.330
I've finally got rid of them.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.690
They just wouldn't leave me alone.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.159
Give it to me, little raccoon dog demon!

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.180
How bold of you
to steal Young Master Fugui's sword!

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.810
Young Master Fugui.

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.610
You humans are all terrible beings!

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:06.170
I bet you came to the Peach Village

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:07.700
to cause Mr. Zhang trouble!

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.690
I won't let you see him.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.250
Tonight,

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:12.910
neither of you can leave here!

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:22.860
Young Master Fugui,

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.820
something seems off with the fog.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.050
This is the poisonous fog
around the Peach Village.

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:28.910
Be careful. Hold your breath now.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:51.930
I've set up barriers.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.490
This toxic fog will disperse
tomorrow morning.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:55.880
Let's wait the night out here.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:56.730
So beautiful.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:00.570
Young Master Fugui,

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:01.630
come over and look!

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.690
The toxic fog has 7 colors!

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:08.130
No, no, no.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.880
Now it has 18 colors.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:12.440
It has turned purple!

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:14.760
So pretty!

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.050
It's purple!

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:16.730
Qingtong.

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:19.850
Qingtong?

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.080
There's a little fox here.

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:26.930
Young Master Fugui,

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:28.520
it's saying hi to me.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.050
Little fox,

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.440
hello.

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:34.180
My name is Qingtong.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:35.690
What's your name?

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:37.130
What is it?

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:38.810
Qingtong,

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.370
this noxious fog
is giving you hallucinations.

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:42.170
Come here.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:45.370
Hallucinations?

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.340
I'm not hallucinating, Young Master Fugui.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.450
I can prove it, Young Master Fugui.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.840
See,

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.760
this is Young Master Fugui's

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:57.810
nose.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:01.370
Here's your mouth.

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.610
You have such long eyelashes.

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:06.200
Qingtong.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.330
I'd like to touch...

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:09.070
You've been poisoned.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.660
Now, hold your breath
and reverse the energy circulation.

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.370
Hold my breath...

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.120
Little Fugui, Little Fugui!

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.090
What are you doing here?

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.820
Although you're a naughty trouble maker

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:37.090
that walks awkwardly,

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:38.920
I still like you.

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:41.220
You're my favorite!

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.520
I wish...

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:49.490
I wish Young Master Fugui
could live your life.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.640
That way,

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.130
he could swim

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.450
whenever he wants.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:55.800
He could eat

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.010
whenever he wants.

00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:58.370
He could sleep

00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:59.490
whenever he wants.

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:02.420
He could do anything as he pleases.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:05.090
Isn't it nice for him to have freedom?

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:07.880
Don't you think so,

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:13.680
Little Fugui?

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.450
Duckling,

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:31.040
why don't I tell you a secret?

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:34.640
Here it goes.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.880
In fact...

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:42.330
Young Master Fugui brought me here

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:46.610
with the intention of bidding me farewell.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.610
I completely

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:53.160
understand

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.810
why he's doing this.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:59.130
Young Master Fugui
wants to give me freedom.

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:01.010
But...

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:04.490
But, dear duckling,

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.760
what will
Young Master Fugui's life be like

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:14.130
without my care?

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.520
There are things you may not know...

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.130
Young Master Fugui

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.090
only eats 3 steamed buns

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:30.370
and sleeps 4 hours

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:32.880
a day.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.210
Without me,

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.640
he wouldn't even get to speak a sentence
in a whole day.

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:47.640
If I leave,

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.490
who will take care of him?

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:12.010
Fugui has his own pursuit of truths.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.850
When he finds them,

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:18.850
he will be free.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:48.580
Young Master Fugui,

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.330
last night,

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:53.060
was I inflicted by the noxious fog?

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:53.970
Yes.

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:59.910
So I was indeed affected
by the poisonous fog...

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:02.040
Well,

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:03.520
I didn't talk

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.090
much nonsense last night, did I?

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:09.530
You were sound asleep

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:11.640
with the sword in your hands.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:18.420
That's a relief.

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:21.970
Thank goodness.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.200
I'm glad I didn't talk nonsense.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.400
We've wasted too much time here.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.530
Let's get out first.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.010
Young Master Fugui!

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:33.400
Wait for me!

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:35.380
Young Master Fugui!

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:45.680
After being stuck here for a long time,

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.130
they must be either dizzy or delirious.

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:48.450
I'm going to knock them out
with this stick

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:49.910
and send them to Mr. Zhang.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.020
Where are they?

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:08.410
Why did you steal my sword

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.720
and lure me into this forest
filled with toxic fog?

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:13.920
I was trying to save
the residents of the Peach Village.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.320
I didn't mean to harm you.

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:17.730
My plan was only to
keep you here for a night.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.210
Then, you'd knock us out with this stick

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.490
and send us to Mr. Zhang,

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:25.010
right?

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.300
I'm sorry. I did wrong.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.480
Sir, Miss, please spare my life.

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:32.850
Tell me the truth,

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:34.130
or you won't live.

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:34.880
I...

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.330
I recognized your sword.

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:40.340
This is a top-class magic tool.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.010
In Yiqi Alliance,
those who can use this sword

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:44.330
are no ordinary people.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:45.760
The elite members of Yiqi Alliance

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:47.250
are as cruel as the Soldier.

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:49.010
They kill demons when they spot one.

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:51.400
Mr. Zhang has given many favors
to us demons.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.640
Have I seen her somewhere else?

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:56.280
Where is Zhang Qi now?

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:57.520
I...

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:01.160
I don't know.

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:02.800
I do fear death,

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:05.210
but since Mr. Zhang is my lifesaver,

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:06.740
I won't tell you where he is!

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:17.849
The villagers
only consist of humans and demons.

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:19.329
If I wanted to kill demons,

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.119
why would you still be alive?

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.010
As per the rule of Yiqi Alliance,

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:24.920
only those who cross the line
to commit crimes will die.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:25.650
Understood?

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.610
Understood.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.680
Sir, miss, you're both nice people.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.640
As long as
I don't cross the line to commit crimes,

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:35.090
though I tricked you
into the forest full of noxious fog,

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:36.420
I don't have to die, huh?

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.640
Take us to Zhang Qi.

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:40.730
I'm here to help him.

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:44.920
Today is the 15th day of the month.
There will be a full moon tonight.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:45.920
At night,

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.780
there will be
gorgeous peach blossoms on this tree.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.560
Look, everyone is dressed up.

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:51.680
Slow down.

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.370
They're getting ready
to watch peach blossoms tonight.

00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:59.280
Mr. Zhang's home is up there.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.640
But I'm not sure

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.700
if he has returned.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:02.800
Well...

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:03.860
I'm getting going.

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:09.010
Young Master Fugui
hasn't finished speaking yet.

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.760
Don't tell anyone who I am.

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:13.500
I definitely won't.

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:14.620
Rest assured, sir.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.290
Young Master Fugui,

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:23.970
I found this little raccoon dog demon
familiar.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:25.840
I have an idea.

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:27.630
Why don't I follow her?

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:29.850
Do it then.

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:30.920
Okay.

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:46.670
Little raccoon dog demon!

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:48.100
Where are you going?

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:52.560
I... I...

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.560
I didn't tell anyone about you guys.

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:57.250
I'm just a poor little raccoon dog demon.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:00.450
A poor little raccoon dog demon?

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:01.800
Hmm.

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:04.800
However,

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.690
I've heard
that in your raccoon dog demon clan,

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:09.420
a specific member aged over 900

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.490
is quite cunning and crafty.

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.840
She enjoys snatching intelligence business
from the Silk Cave, which I'm from.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:16.760
Besides,

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:20.020
she has stolen and eaten
your demon king's Glazed Fruit.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:20.800
I...

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:21.840
Well...

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:24.970
I'm in the Peach Village now.

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:26.520
Mr. Zhang is in charge of this place.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.080
Even our demon king is no match for him.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:28.650
Fine.

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:31.010
A demon's nature is hard to be changed.

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:32.410
I'm sure you haven't shaken off the habit

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:33.690
of sneaking glances at intelligence.

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:35.150
There must be many scrolls

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.120
of classified information in your room.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:37.650
Alright.

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:38.760
I'll go check them out.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.560
It's not true!

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:41.840
-I'm not hiding anything in there!
-I was right. They're in your room.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:42.280
I...

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:44.320
Just let me take a look!

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:44.760
You...

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:50.010
Still denying it?

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.520
Come on, little raccoon dog demon.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.250
Hand over all the scrolls.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:11.530
Black Sword.

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:30.730
Soldier.

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:51.650
I knew you would come,

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.100
but I didn't expect to see you so soon.

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:57.870
I'm no longer
the Master of the Zhang family.

00:20:58.170 --> 00:20:58.930
I know.

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:00.990
You're not holding

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.000
the Black Sword anymore.

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:06.710
People have different aspirations.

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.450
Though the Peach Village
belongs to Yiqi Alliance,

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:09.760
it used to be a barren land,

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.410
and it won't be anyone's hindrance.

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:13.280
I only want to give the villagers a home,

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:14.880
where they can make a living.

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:20.070
A home for both humans and demons?

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.420
Is it why you forsook the Black Sword?

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.840
My heart has a place for the sword.

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.360
How could you say I forsook it?

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.560
Soldier,
you have a sword of unmatched speed.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:32.020
Have you found the truths of swordsmanship
that you yearn for?

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:35.690
I'm here to take you back

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.610
at my master's request.

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:41.760
You and I are both swordsmen.

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.410
Let's transfer our spirits to the swords

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:45.080
and have a debate on swordsmanship.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:45.890
If you win,

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.740
I'll let you have your way.

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:04.730
It's right to eliminate the evil.

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:06.260
It's also right to stop war.

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:07.690
The sword essence is about liberty.

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:08.760
What's there not to do?

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.360
One's heart determines
what his sword skills are like.

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:11.890
You act at will—that's your style.

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:13.760
I have a pure heart—that's my style.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:14.930
I protect the world with my sword.

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:16.990
Every time I launches a sword strike,

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.120
I suffer a loss.

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:25.410
Using the sword with the Heart of Sword

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:27.410
is a way to nourish the Heart of Sword

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:29.490
and to sharpen the blade.

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:44.560
You do live up to your reputation,
Soldier.

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:45.080
I lost.

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:47.340
If I agree to go with you,

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:51.210
will you spare the humans and demons
in the Peach Village?

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.250
Do you also think...

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.940
that I'm here to take their lives?

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:01.940
Aren't you?

00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:03.270
I came to see you

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:07.800
because a nefarious drug
has been released from this very place.

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.060
It's a pernicious pill

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:10.520
shaped like a bird's eye,

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:12.560
called Chakuwa.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.040
Chakuwa?

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:17.490
Never heard of that.

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:19.930
I've never made
pills or elixirs for evil use.

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:21.760
In my whole life,
apart from sword practice,

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:23.620
I enjoy nothing but wood carving.

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:25.450
I have no knowledge of pills or elixirs.

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:26.180
Impossible.

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.060
Such harmful pills
did come from this place.

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:32.570
The intelligence I received

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.180
can't be wrong.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:35.840
I understand.

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.040
This is a serious matter.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.040
I'll probe into this issue in the village

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.040
and reply to you as soon as possible.

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:42.140
Soldier, please

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:44.210
give me some time.

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:47.250
Okay.

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:50.340
Young Master Fugui!

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:51.320
Look at these.

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:54.360
What are they?

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:58.560
You must be Mr. Zhang.

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:03.130
These are Jiu's scrolls of intelligence.

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:04.800
Since she arrived at the Peach Village,

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.010
she's been snooping around

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:07.450
to gather every villager's

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:08.410
information.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.890
She makes a business out of selling it.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:15.490
Mr. Zhang,

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:17.690
why aren't you surprised at all?

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.240
This is no surprise to me.

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:21.170
After all,
she has an insatiable appetite to feed,

00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:21.900
doesn't she?

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:28.250
Jiu not only has

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:30.540
terrible handwriting,

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.680
but also bad drawing skills.

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:34.040
Young Master Fugui,

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.450
I've asked her.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:36.690
She told me

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:38.450
that circles refer to...

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:39.490
Circles refer to humans.

00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:39.890
[Granny Shui]

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:40.360
[Rouli People]

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.220
One cross means one little demon.

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.450
Two crosses represent a strong demon.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.210
Exactly.

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.240
What beautiful flowers.

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:03.710
They smell so good.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.040
Mr. Zhang,

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:08.730
what kind of flowers are these?

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:10.040
They're Changchun Flowers,

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:11.770
the favorite of my wife Qingli.

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:12.760
When managed well,

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.360
they can bloom twice a month.

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.360
There's enormous vitality in them.

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:17.490
"Qingli"?

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:19.670
Such a beautiful name.

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:21.410
She must be

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.690
a pretty lady, isn't she?

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:25.690
My wife is a butterfly demon.

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:27.150
She's indeed very pretty.

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:29.890
A butterfly demon...

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:33.120
If you like this pot of flowers,

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:33.890
take it as a gift.

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:34.420
Soldier,

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.380
I'm going to inspect the village.

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:41.650
Mr. Xu.

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:42.170
Hey!

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:43.370
Going fishing again?

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:44.220
You bet I am.

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:46.450
I created a new bait last night.

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:48.320
I can definitely catch a big fish with it.

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.490
Mr. Zhang, you see, Jiu left

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:52.320
a duckling behind at the pier again.

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.080
Oh, this girl...

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.080
Then hide this duckling at my place.

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:56.890
When she can't find it,
she'll learn a lesson.

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:58.280
Okay, let's do it.

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:01.060
The Peach Village is such a magical place.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.360
Here,

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:04.730
humans and demons peacefully coexist

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:06.190
without discrimination.

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:09.210
Black Sword is in love
with a butterfly demon.

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:11.010
It's as beautiful as a dream.

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:15.930
At this moment,

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:18.080
I truly hope I can

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.890
stay in this dream forever.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:38.970
Young Master Fugui,

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:40.700
have you finished the reading?

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:42.020
All the information

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.560
was compiled by Jiu

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:46.890
according to
the humans' and demons' own narratives.

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:48.820
They all seem to be regular beings,

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:51.360
but the accounts of a human and 3 demons

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.440
contradict the information

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:54.760
I sorted.

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:57.080
Contradict?

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.360
Then there must be a problem.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.170
Young Master Fugui,

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:07.650
I know just the right thing to do.

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:08.650
I'll go find them.

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:09.970
Leave this matter to me.

00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:10.450
Okay.

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:29.040
Bless my mother with good health.

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.420
Bless my mother with good health.

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:34.310
Bless my mother with good health.

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:52.840
Is he the guy?

00:27:58.600 --> 00:27:59.730
Young Master Fugui,

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.080
I already found the human and demons

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.280
you were looking for.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:05.180
I'm so thirsty.

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:08.490
Young Master Fugui,

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.170
That's Xu Feng, a green demon.

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:10.890
I got this today.

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:13.020
He came to the Peach Village a year ago.

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:15.030
Now, he lives next to Granny Shui.

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:16.210
He's good at fishing.

00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:17.490
He goes out early and comes home late.

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:18.690
Every time he gets a full basket of fish,

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:21.620
he'd give it away to the villagers,
from door to door.

00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:23.470
Now I remember him.

00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:27.380
Young Master Fugui,

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:28.690
you know each other?

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.420
He once stopped my Palanquin,

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:35.740
trying to challenge me.

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:38.080
He didn't do evil,

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:39.880
so I stayed in the Palanquin.

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:41.860
We did have a casual fight, though.

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:47.890
Xu Feng.

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:52.480
I've seen you before.

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:55.020
Your name isn't Xu Feng, but Zeng Ming.

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.050
Three years ago,

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.120
you challenged the Soldier.

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:07.320
It seems someone does remember

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:09.120
an old and small heroic act of mine.

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.120
Well, I'm very much flattered.

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.200
In fact,
I was only fighting a hopeless battle.

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.080
If Yiqi Alliance hadn't seized

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.930
the territory of us green demons,

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:19.790
we wouldn’t have become homeless

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.440
or been bullied everywhere.

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:25.800
Seek revenge from who wronged you.

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.040
You should've fought

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.570
the one that took your land.

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:30.320
Why did you have to challenge the Soldier?

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.320
Wasn't it a foolish thing to do?

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:33.170
But...

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.600
The Soldier's support
is exactly the reason

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.690
for Yiqi Alliance's

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:39.490
arrogance and unscrupulousness.

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:40.280
Besides,

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.360
the Soldier kills demons,

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:42.160
always saying

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.650
that those who cross the line
to commit crimes must die.

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:45.120
Then...

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:47.800
When those from Yiqi Alliance
cross the line to commit crimes,

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.530
should they be executed or not?

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:51.600
I challenged him that day

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:53.420
because I wanted an answer.

00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:55.040
But now,

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:57.560
I have a new home.

00:29:58.170 --> 00:29:58.840
All of that

00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:00.450
was water under the bridge.

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:02.490
Sir, miss, are you new here?

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:05.650
Your lives would turn a new leaf

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:07.380
as you reach the Peach Village.

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:08.400
Oh, right.

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:12.820
We had quite a talk.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.140
I'd like to give you

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:15.280
these two fish.

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:17.760
I'll take them.

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:18.490
Here you are.

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:22.800
Well, I shall take my leave.

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:34.100
Young Master Fugui,

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:37.100
your doubts about this green demon

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:38.970
have all been cleared up, right?

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:40.670
He conceals his real identity

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.520
probably out of fear
of implicating the Peach Village

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.520
since he once offended the Soldier.

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:49.690
He's clean.

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.690
Fuying the snake demon is a music fanatic.

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.840
He's obsessed with string and wind music.

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.100
He tried to learn music

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:07.120
from a great music master.

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:09.120
After being discovered,

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:11.520
he fled to the Peach Village
half a year ago.

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:15.970
What a lovely tune.

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:19.520
But it sounds

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:21.690
a bit melancholy.

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:22.800
Fuying...

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:25.140
is not a snake demon.

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:27.360
He's half dragon.

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:28.690
And that man

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:30.850
is no ordinary music master.

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:32.210
Half a year ago,

00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:34.730
an elder of the Ximen family
suddenly destroyed his own cultivation

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:36.860
and was then expelled from the family.

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:38.090
I think...

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:40.170
that man is the elder.

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:42.890
Young Master Fugui,

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:44.120
have you found

00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:46.750
anything suspicious about them?

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:51.890
Music comes from the heart.

00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:53.570
It reflects one's thoughts.

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:56.060
Judging from this tune,

00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.020
I think they're clean.

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:05.040
Then let's move on to the last target
—a deer demon.

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.120
This very deer demon

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:08.040
picks flowers in the mountain
all year round

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:09.640
and is rarely seen by others.

00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:10.950
But I'm sure he will

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:13.510
go watch the peach blossoms tonight.

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:15.690
That being the case,

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:16.760
Young Master Fugui,

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:17.800
let's head back.

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:19.410
He'll absolutely be there

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:21.210
for the peach blossoms tonight.

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:24.520
Okay.

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:43.360
Why are all

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.920
the centers of the flowers gone?

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:50.690
Here you are.

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:51.280
Thanks.

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:53.600
This is yours.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:54.210
Thank you.

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:57.120
How nice.

00:32:58.250 --> 00:32:58.980
Here you are.

00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:01.530
Thank you.

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:04.930
You busy?

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:05.730
Here you come.

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.410
I've brought you good news, Granny Shui.

00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:10.070
I collected

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:11.930
these new seeds today.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:13.520
Small though they look,

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.080
they'll grow into large flowers

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.320
that you can sell.

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:17.380
They're valuable.

00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:28.100
Young Master Fugui,

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:29.600
someone's cooking in the kitchen.

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:30.530
She's so pretty,

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:31.690
just like a fairy.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:33.890
If I'm not mistaken,

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:35.170
that lady

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.210
must be Qingli.

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:39.260
Yes. That's my wife Qingli.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:42.760
Young Master Fugui,

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:43.620
here she comes.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:56.800
I'm Qingli, a butterfly demon.
Nice to meet you, Soldier.

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:01.890
Soldier, are you shocked by the fact

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:03.840
that Qi told me who you are?

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:06.220
Don't be surprised by that.

00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:07.970
There have never been secrets

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:09.360
between Qi and me.

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:11.130
We live and die together.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:19.280
Qingli,

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:21.730
Young Master Fugui

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.580
never drinks alcohol.

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:32.770
Soldier,
you're not in the Wangquan Manor now.

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.060
Do you think it's worth

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:36.469
having a drink for the Peach Village?

00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:42.449
The hollow of Dingling Mountain
is plagued by noxious fog all year round.

00:34:42.449 --> 00:34:44.489
Upon arriving here alone,

00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:45.560
Qi spent 7 years

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.120
risking his life to clean up the air.

00:34:48.449 --> 00:34:51.050
That was how the Peach Village
came into being.

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:52.199
Soldiers,

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.010
is that worth a drink?

00:34:56.489 --> 00:34:56.969
Sure.

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:08.930
Qingli,

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.360
you'll host
the Night Peach Ceremony later.

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:12.560
Don't drink too much.

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:14.910
Everyone, easy on the drinks.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:15.450
Okay.

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.720
The Night Peach Ceremony...

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:21.840
Mr. Zhang, Qingli,

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.760
what's the Night Peach Ceremony about?

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:26.080
Also,

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.010
Mr. Zhang,

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.520
how did you meet Qingli?

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:32.800
When I was young,

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:33.860
I always dreamed of

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:35.010
creating a paradise

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:36.870
where killings wouldn't happen.

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.560
For that aspiration,

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:40.320
I did spent 7 years

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:41.450
in the mountain.

00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:42.890
In the fifth year,

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:45.290
the noxious fog became less.

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:47.170
Some humans and demons started

00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:48.630
setting foot on this land.

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:51.120
That was also

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:53.490
when I met Qingli.

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:55.490
Stop running!

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.170
Freeze! Stop there!

00:35:59.010 --> 00:35:59.970
You stop there!

00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:03.430
You'll be dead meat when we catch you!

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:06.450
Little butterfly demon,

00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:08.310
you're not going anywhere today!

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.360
Nobody will come to your rescue!

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:14.810
Run, I dare you.

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:27.640
Leave now.

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:38.720
Since then,

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.600
as a way to repay my kindness,

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:43.800
Qingli often came to the Peach Village
to keep me company.

At that time,

all I wanted to do
was build up the Peach Village.

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:40.410
I brought the humans and demons
I had saved to this place,

00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:41.150

How exactly did Qingli

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:33.370
persuade the villagers to stay?

00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:36.720
-Back then, Qingli and I...
-Why not let them

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:37.810
see for themselves

00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:40.370
how I made that happen
when a full moon shows up?

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:41.430
That's a good idea.

00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:46.050
The Peach Village
is indeed a wonderful place.

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:47.370
But someone

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:49.640
is doing evil here.

00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:54.740
I haven't found a lead about that yet.

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:56.240
But I've ordered

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.960
all the humans and demons

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.170
to stay put before the truth comes out.

00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:01.860
Of course they can't leave.

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:04.930
The back mountain
is surrounded by noxious fog.

00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:06.790
The entrance to the Peach Village

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:08.560
has been sealed

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:10.920
by my 4 sword attendants.

00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:19.970
Mr. Zhang, Qingli,

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:21.890
do you know what this is?

00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:23.490
It's a Phoenix Flower.

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:25.330
Little Deer gave out
its seeds to the villagers.

00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:27.120
These flowers have just bloomed recently.

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:27.920
So beautiful.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:28.720
Yes.

00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:31.040
Indeed.

00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:33.630
"Little Deer"?

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.900
You mean Lu Shu the deer demon?

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:36.770
Yes.

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:39.520
He has a great passion for flowers.

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.520
Did he come from Xishu

00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:43.290
a year ago?

00:40:44.890 --> 00:40:45.490
Yes.

00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:47.820
He's been lying.

00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:51.350
Due to the desolation
of the forest in Xishu,

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:52.850
two years ago,

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:55.540
all the deer demons
already left that place.

00:40:57.970 --> 00:40:59.490
I'll have my men track him down.
