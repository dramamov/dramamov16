I'd like to help.

00:01:06.527 --> 00:01:08.227
Someone could die,

00:01:08.837 --> 00:01:10.497
or we might have to kill someone.

00:01:10.905 --> 00:01:14.745
The two of them might go back farther than you think.

00:01:15.507 --> 00:01:18.947
- So it is anger, after all. - So even if I get my revenge,

00:01:19.277 --> 00:01:20.877
are you saying that would be okay?

00:01:22.277 --> 00:01:23.377
Does he want me...

00:01:24.347 --> 00:01:25.387
to kill him?

00:01:26.087 --> 00:01:30.687
- Pluto didn't open up. - You two, go get Mr. Jang.

Who said you could just come back to Korea?

00:01:33.887 --> 00:01:36.057
This is mine. Hold on.

00:01:36.527 --> 00:01:38.497
This is big. I'm telling you, it's huge.

00:01:38.567 --> 00:01:42.297
I'll get you that money. Where did you hide the original USB?

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:47.507
- It's all over now. - I have the original.

00:01:52.107 --> 00:01:53.907
I'm going to end this now.

00:01:58.917 --> 00:02:00.887
Honey, the bag.

00:02:01.717 --> 00:02:02.717
Hey, Jun.

00:02:03.057 --> 00:02:06.157
- Bye. Have a good day. - You're coming to get me, right?

00:02:06.227 --> 00:02:08.927
Of course. I promise I'll come get you later.

Let's say Yun Dong Hee killed Kim Yong Woo.

00:02:52.807 --> 00:02:54.067
To make it look like an accident,

00:02:54.137 --> 00:02:57.337
he would've tailed him for days. And this place was on his route.

00:02:57.737 --> 00:02:59.147
So what's here?

00:02:59.677 --> 00:03:01.547
Someone who can't afford to run into Yun Dong Hee.

00:03:03.447 --> 00:03:05.147
- Hey, watch your step. - Okay.

00:03:09.887 --> 00:03:11.717
I told you we should've just gone straight home.

00:03:12.087 --> 00:03:14.827
I said I need the scooter for my deliveries tomorrow morning.

00:03:15.527 --> 00:03:16.897
I'll bring it to you in the morning.

- Now forwarding to voicemail. - Detective Kang?

00:03:31.307 --> 00:03:33.907
- What brings you here? - Is something wrong?

00:03:34.107 --> 00:03:37.617
Mr. Shin's phone is off. Is there another way to contact him?

00:03:37.947 --> 00:03:40.247
But he never turns his phone off, no matter what.

00:03:41.217 --> 00:03:43.617
The phone is off. Now forwarding to voicemail...

00:03:44.757 --> 00:03:45.927
He's really not picking up.

00:03:46.957 --> 00:03:49.497
- Do you know where Mr. Shin lives? - Yes. Let's go.

Where am I?

00:04:08.407 --> 00:04:09.547
Untie me.

00:04:12.487 --> 00:04:13.787
Come on, untie me.

00:04:14.047 --> 00:04:15.357
I said, untie me now!

00:04:17.117 --> 00:04:18.357
Why are you doing this to me?

00:04:19.457 --> 00:04:21.757
Why are you doing this to me?

00:04:25.257 --> 00:04:26.467
Please, let me go.

00:04:27.697 --> 00:04:28.697
But why...

00:04:29.667 --> 00:04:30.937
Why are you doing this to me?

00:04:37.877 --> 00:04:38.877
Let me go.

00:04:45.717 --> 00:04:48.147
- Why did you do it? - This is insane.

00:04:50.657 --> 00:04:51.717
I really don't know.

00:04:52.487 --> 00:04:53.587
I really don't know.

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:55.857
I don't remember, I swear.

00:04:56.357 --> 00:04:57.357
I...

00:04:58.157 --> 00:04:59.927
I told you, I don't remember!

00:05:00.397 --> 00:05:01.997
This isn't fair.

00:05:02.337 --> 00:05:04.837
This isn't fair to me, either. For something I don't even remember,

00:05:04.897 --> 00:05:07.637
I was locked away for 15 years.

00:05:14.607 --> 00:05:15.617
Hold on.

00:05:16.077 --> 00:05:17.877
- What's the room number? - Room 301.

00:05:17.947 --> 00:05:20.017
No, wait. You two wait here.

00:05:20.087 --> 00:05:21.617
- You, with me. - Yes, sir.

00:05:41.037 --> 00:05:42.037
Anyone home?

00:05:57.287 --> 00:05:58.357
Sir.

00:05:59.887 --> 00:06:00.987
You have to see this.

00:06:18.037 --> 00:06:19.247
You don't remember?

00:06:20.077 --> 00:06:21.477
How could you not remember?

00:06:23.117 --> 00:06:25.487
I remember it every single day.

00:06:26.487 --> 00:06:27.687
Remember it, you son of a witch.

00:06:28.147 --> 00:06:31.687
Remember every last detail.

00:06:38.867 --> 00:06:39.927
You think this...

00:06:40.497 --> 00:06:42.497
is going to bring your darn kid back?

00:06:51.307 --> 00:06:54.877
No, stop. Stop it, spare my life.

00:06:55.107 --> 00:06:56.577
Please, spare my life.

00:06:58.077 --> 00:06:59.217
If this is how it's going to be,

00:06:59.617 --> 00:07:00.747
then just kill me, you punk.

00:07:01.287 --> 00:07:02.487
Just kill me.

00:07:39.657 --> 00:07:41.887
Sir.

00:07:42.427 --> 00:07:44.797
My phone...

00:07:45.427 --> 00:07:49.237
I need to take this call, sir.

00:07:49.597 --> 00:07:50.697
Sir, my phone!

00:07:50.767 --> 00:07:51.997
(Teacher)

00:07:52.437 --> 00:07:53.437
Don't.

00:07:54.137 --> 00:07:55.237
Don't touch it.

00:07:55.977 --> 00:07:57.437
Don't touch my phone, sir.

00:07:58.007 --> 00:07:59.007
Sir.

00:07:59.947 --> 00:08:00.947
Sir...

00:08:01.647 --> 00:08:03.317
Let me make one call.

00:08:04.277 --> 00:08:05.647
Sir, don't do it!

00:08:06.647 --> 00:08:07.647
Stop it!

00:08:10.457 --> 00:08:13.627
- Did you take care of it? - Just let me see it for a second.

00:08:14.157 --> 00:08:15.227
What did it say?

00:08:19.567 --> 00:08:22.437
What exactly did the message say? Please?

00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:25.097
Don't you touch my phone!

00:08:36.317 --> 00:08:38.647
(It's all taken care of.)

00:08:46.187 --> 00:08:47.727
Good work.

00:08:50.027 --> 00:08:51.027
Good...

00:08:53.067 --> 00:08:54.067
bye.

00:08:54.967 --> 00:08:57.337
(Good work. Goodbye.)

00:08:58.067 --> 00:09:00.837
What are you doing with my phone! Darn it!

00:09:01.737 --> 00:09:03.807
Is it Lee Heo Jun? Is he your "teacher?"

00:09:06.777 --> 00:09:08.447
I'm sorry. I'll apologize, okay?

00:09:09.217 --> 00:09:10.847
For what happened to your son, I'll...

00:09:11.417 --> 00:09:14.317
I'll give you a formal apology. I'm so sorry!

00:09:15.147 --> 00:09:19.087
I admit I was wrong. But what did that message say?

00:09:19.757 --> 00:09:22.027
- Please, just tell me that. - Is it Lee Heo Jun?

00:09:23.127 --> 00:09:26.097
Was Lee Heo Jun behind all of this?

00:09:32.407 --> 00:09:34.607
What happened between you and Lee Heo Jun that day?

00:10:01.167 --> 00:10:02.167
I...

00:10:03.767 --> 00:10:07.737
I really don't remember. I had lunch and some water.

00:10:07.807 --> 00:10:09.337
I really don't remember.

00:10:09.407 --> 00:10:13.947
I didn't even know who your son was.

00:10:17.847 --> 00:10:19.717
Did Lee Heo Jun tell you to "handle" it?

00:10:23.387 --> 00:10:24.587
Darn you.

00:10:59.987 --> 00:11:02.627
I really don't remember.

00:11:02.727 --> 00:11:06.097
I had lunch and some water.

00:11:22.147 --> 00:11:25.847
I need you to run a location check. Name's Shin Jay, plate 26-Jo 7068.

00:11:25.917 --> 00:11:26.917
I'll check it myself.

00:11:26.987 --> 00:11:29.487
Hey, you can't. It's a crime scene. You're not allowed in.

00:11:29.587 --> 00:11:32.017
You called forensics, right? What did you find at the scene?

00:11:32.087 --> 00:11:35.487
I said we need to assess this first.

00:11:36.657 --> 00:11:37.657
(Mr. Shin)

00:11:37.927 --> 00:11:40.397
Mr. Shin, are you all right? Where are you right now?

00:11:40.597 --> 00:11:44.437
I'm fine. I'm sending the location. Come here.

00:11:46.467 --> 00:11:48.507
- Mr. Shin. - Detective Choi.

00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:49.677
Are you alone right now?

00:11:57.447 --> 00:12:02.217
So according to you, Yun Dong Hee's killed five people, including Jun.

00:12:02.487 --> 00:12:06.257
Yes. But that psycho went after Mr. Shin.

00:12:07.987 --> 00:12:10.957
- We have to catch him. - I will catch him my way.

00:12:11.897 --> 00:12:13.127
If you ask me,

00:12:14.667 --> 00:12:16.537
I think Mr. Shin already knew.

00:12:17.267 --> 00:12:19.667
- Knew what? - That Yun Dong Hee was coming.

00:12:33.987 --> 00:12:38.087
You should've called me, or at least reported it to the police!

00:12:38.157 --> 00:12:41.127
What were you thinking, bringing that punk here?

00:12:43.227 --> 00:12:46.627
Anyway, I'll take over the investigation from here.

00:12:47.197 --> 00:12:48.627
So you're done here, Mr. Shin.

00:12:48.927 --> 00:12:50.767
You've committed kidnapping, confinement, and more.

00:12:50.837 --> 00:12:54.367
Detective! How can you say that when you know?

00:12:54.507 --> 00:12:56.207
The situation is what it is!

00:12:56.737 --> 00:12:59.377
I mean, why are you taking it this far?

00:13:00.277 --> 00:13:02.177
Why my son died...

00:13:03.477 --> 00:13:05.917
I still haven't gotten any answers.

00:13:06.017 --> 00:13:08.487
This is driving me crazy. Seriously.

00:13:09.587 --> 00:13:11.557
What happened that day...

00:13:11.987 --> 00:13:13.457
I have to find out, no matter what.

00:13:14.927 --> 00:13:15.927
Mr. Shin.

00:13:16.497 --> 00:13:18.797
You have to stop, or this will become a very serious crime.

00:13:18.857 --> 00:13:19.867
Detective Choi.

00:13:20.727 --> 00:13:22.067
The day Jun died,

00:13:23.497 --> 00:13:25.397
Lee Heo Jun met with Yun Dong Hee.

00:13:36.247 --> 00:13:37.377
I'll stay here too.

00:13:39.617 --> 00:13:40.947
You can't do this alone.

00:13:42.787 --> 00:13:44.657
Don't. Just stay out of this.

00:13:45.717 --> 00:13:47.057
I don't care if you're Jun's father.

00:13:49.157 --> 00:13:50.797
As a detective, I'm going to do my job.

00:13:51.827 --> 00:13:52.867
Go ahead.

00:13:54.097 --> 00:13:56.537
You do things your way, Detective Choi.

00:13:59.837 --> 00:14:01.467
Wait. Detective Choi!

00:14:04.477 --> 00:14:05.907
Darn it!

00:14:17.787 --> 00:14:18.957
What are you planning?

00:14:20.957 --> 00:14:21.957
Lee Heo Jun.

00:14:24.327 --> 00:14:25.397
I'm bringing him here.

00:14:27.627 --> 00:14:28.697
Why do you bring him?

00:14:32.497 --> 00:14:33.507
Detective Choi.

00:14:35.407 --> 00:14:36.877
When I bring Lee Heo Jun here...

00:14:55.427 --> 00:14:56.427
Cho Pillip.

00:14:57.227 --> 00:14:59.427
From now on, you're a negotiator for me.

00:15:01.597 --> 00:15:04.797
You can either save me or be the death of me.

00:15:16.677 --> 00:15:17.847
But I have one condition.

00:15:20.247 --> 00:15:21.517
I'm calling the shots this time.

00:15:23.887 --> 00:15:25.657
To do that, I can't be in the dark about anything.

00:15:29.287 --> 00:15:30.297
Detective Choi.

00:15:32.127 --> 00:15:33.127
Please help me.

00:15:37.467 --> 00:15:38.997
I have a condition of my own.

00:15:40.537 --> 00:15:46.077
Never, ever try to take matters into your own hands.

00:15:46.477 --> 00:15:47.477
Got it?

00:15:47.877 --> 00:15:49.247
Because one way or another,

00:15:50.047 --> 00:15:54.587
I'll make sure him rots in prison.

00:16:06.327 --> 00:16:07.327
A kidnapping?

00:16:11.067 --> 00:16:13.907
- Where are they? - Let's go. I'll explain on the way.

00:16:13.967 --> 00:16:15.667
- Let's go! - Right!

00:16:35.257 --> 00:16:37.627
Are you sure? Yes, got it.

00:16:38.127 --> 00:16:40.127
I'm on my way now. Yes, text me the location.

00:16:41.697 --> 00:16:44.597
Kim Yong Woo left behind evidence before he died.

00:16:44.697 --> 00:16:46.937
Where did you hide the original USB?

00:16:48.007 --> 00:16:49.537
Somewhere only Joo Yeong Mi would know.

00:16:51.707 --> 00:16:53.677
We have to find that USB.

00:16:54.777 --> 00:16:56.717
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

00:16:57.417 --> 00:16:59.377
Okay. Be careful.

00:17:06.827 --> 00:17:09.757
Officer Kim? Check for any deposits to Yun Dong Hee's account today.

00:17:09.857 --> 00:17:12.027
Okay. Got it.

00:17:12.397 --> 00:17:14.127
And Si On is going to bring you a USB.

00:17:14.197 --> 00:17:15.497
Crack the password as fast as you can.

00:17:15.767 --> 00:17:19.297
Hey, just tell her to get it here as fast as she can.

00:17:27.077 --> 00:17:28.977
- Ma'am! - Come on in.

00:17:29.047 --> 00:17:30.477
Mr. Shin sent me.

00:17:33.517 --> 00:17:37.787
Madam Joo. These were Kim Yong Woo's last words.

00:17:38.517 --> 00:17:40.787
He said it's in a place only Joo Yeong Mi would know.

00:17:43.197 --> 00:17:44.557
I see you've been going to the temple.

00:17:44.897 --> 00:17:47.567
It can't be for Ji Woo, so who are you praying for?

00:17:47.697 --> 00:17:49.637
Are you spying on me now?

00:18:07.287 --> 00:18:08.617
(Parents: Shin Jay, Son: Shin Jun)

00:18:26.837 --> 00:18:28.107
I hope this helps.

00:18:30.377 --> 00:18:31.437
Thank you.

00:18:31.707 --> 00:18:32.707
Thank you!

00:18:50.297 --> 00:18:52.797
- What are the demands? - Nothing specific yet, sir.

00:18:52.897 --> 00:18:54.827
- The hostage's condition? - We're checking on that now.

00:18:54.897 --> 00:18:56.867
Commissioner, what measures are you taking?

00:18:56.937 --> 00:18:58.767
- Please give us a statement. - What does the hostage-taker want?

00:19:01.007 --> 00:19:02.007
Commissioner.

00:19:02.367 --> 00:19:03.377
What is it?

00:19:03.437 --> 00:19:06.077
I'm Cho Pillip, the negotiator for the hostage-taker.

00:19:25.197 --> 00:19:28.697
Yes. Change the name on Yun's account.

00:19:29.367 --> 00:19:31.267
And block all the connected lines, too.

00:19:32.597 --> 00:19:33.637
Right. Thanks.

00:19:42.477 --> 00:19:44.377
Why isn't this working?

00:19:46.987 --> 00:19:48.087
Come on.

00:19:48.887 --> 00:19:49.887
What's wrong with it?

00:19:52.587 --> 00:19:53.887
This is weird.

00:19:58.327 --> 00:20:01.927
Mr. Shin, Yun's account is blocked. Access has been revoked.

00:20:04.967 --> 00:20:07.537
- What about the USB? - Si On has it.

00:20:07.907 --> 00:20:09.237
What's the status on Lee Heo Jun?

00:20:09.507 --> 00:20:11.807
No progress yet, but Detective Choi went to see him personally.

00:20:13.447 --> 00:20:14.447
All right.

00:20:26.987 --> 00:20:30.057
(Access Denied)

00:20:30.327 --> 00:20:31.727
My money...

00:20:32.157 --> 00:20:33.167
It's my money.

00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:36.737
Have you ever even touched this money?

00:20:38.967 --> 00:20:40.607
From the very beginning, Lee Heo Jun...

00:20:41.467 --> 00:20:43.577
never intended to give you the money.

00:20:46.807 --> 00:20:48.807
The day you stabbed that cop.

00:20:49.247 --> 00:20:53.247
Have you ever stopped to think about why you were even there that day?

00:20:56.557 --> 00:20:58.717
How can I stab you, Teacher?

00:20:59.457 --> 00:21:02.357
No, Dong Hee. You have to do this.

00:21:03.757 --> 00:21:07.327
You just need to make it a shallow cut,

00:21:08.297 --> 00:21:09.837
so don't overthink it.

00:21:13.107 --> 00:21:14.107
Okay.

00:21:15.637 --> 00:21:18.337
I'll try.

00:21:20.807 --> 00:21:23.977
You see Lee Heo Jun was on the phone with the police that day?

00:21:24.977 --> 00:21:27.687
The cops showing up wasn't a coincidence.

00:21:27.747 --> 00:21:28.747
(Detailed Call Log: June 2025)

00:21:28.817 --> 00:21:29.817
(Called: Lee Heo Jun)

00:21:29.987 --> 00:21:31.557
To Lee Heo Jun, you were...

00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:36.997
nothing more than trash to be used and thrown away.

00:21:40.197 --> 00:21:42.127
Cut the crap, you punk.

00:21:48.737 --> 00:21:52.807
We have breaking news. An escaped inmate identified as Yun,

00:21:52.877 --> 00:21:55.807
is reportedly holding a civilian hostage.

00:21:56.277 --> 00:21:58.447
Details are still emerging. A SWAT team has been deployed...

00:21:58.517 --> 00:21:59.517
So much for "handling it."

00:21:59.517 --> 00:22:02.117
where a tense standoff is currently underway.

00:22:03.187 --> 00:22:07.557
The news surprised me, too. What brings you to the hospital?

00:22:07.627 --> 00:22:10.997
Yes, just like on the news, Yun Dong Hee has a hostage.

00:22:12.097 --> 00:22:17.067
I need to ask a favor. We need a psychiatrist who knows him.

00:22:17.397 --> 00:22:21.367
Is anyone at your hospital who could join us at the scene?

00:22:31.417 --> 00:22:33.547
I'll go.

00:22:34.787 --> 00:22:38.217
- You'll come yourself? - I'm the expert in this field,

00:22:38.487 --> 00:22:41.487
and I know Yun Dong Hee better than anyone.

00:22:42.557 --> 00:22:45.657
I'll meet you outside with my stuff.

00:22:45.657 --> 00:22:46.997
Yes, of course.

00:22:51.067 --> 00:22:52.267
Thank you.

00:23:20.667 --> 00:23:21.827
How much longer?

00:23:22.227 --> 00:23:27.137
I can't concentrate with you standing over my shoulder like that.

00:23:32.337 --> 00:23:35.947
Don't just sit there and watch. Don't you have something else to do?

00:23:36.107 --> 00:23:37.377
Nothing.

00:23:42.017 --> 00:23:43.487
(USB Device Password Decrypted)

00:23:43.587 --> 00:23:46.157
- I got it! It's done! - You cracked it?

00:23:46.217 --> 00:23:47.227
Hold on, just a second.

00:23:47.627 --> 00:23:50.257
It's done. Here you go.

00:23:50.457 --> 00:23:52.927
- Thank you. - Be careful with that!

00:23:53.097 --> 00:23:54.327
- Who's that? - It's Lee Heo Jun.

00:23:54.397 --> 00:23:55.667
- It's Lee Heo Jun! - That's Lee Heo Jun!

00:23:55.727 --> 00:23:56.737
It's Lee Heo Jun.

00:24:07.277 --> 00:24:08.547
I appreciate you all being here.

00:24:09.177 --> 00:24:11.217
Although I have resigned from my public position,

00:24:12.217 --> 00:24:13.917
he was a patient under my care.

00:24:14.387 --> 00:24:15.687
I'll do everything I can to help.

00:24:16.717 --> 00:24:19.757
- In that case... - What will you say to Yun Dong Hee?

00:24:24.227 --> 00:24:25.557
Look at that. Your dear teacher is on his way.

00:24:29.527 --> 00:24:30.867
I appreciate you all being here.

00:24:31.967 --> 00:24:33.867
Although I have resigned from my public position,

00:24:34.437 --> 00:24:36.437
he was a patient under my care.

00:24:37.337 --> 00:24:41.147
- I'll do everything I can to help. - 15 years ago, Lee Heo Jun...

00:24:41.647 --> 00:24:43.617
had you locked up in the Federal Medical Center,

00:24:45.277 --> 00:24:47.187
I wonder what he'll do to you this time.

00:24:48.517 --> 00:24:50.587
(Hostage-taker: Yun Dong Hee, Hostage: Shin Jay)

00:24:52.187 --> 00:24:56.857
The hostage is the father of the kid Yun Dong Hee killed 15 years ago.

00:24:56.927 --> 00:24:59.327
- What are his demands? - Money for a clear escape.

00:24:59.457 --> 00:25:01.967
Is this guy insane? As if killing the kid wasn't enough,

00:25:02.027 --> 00:25:04.197
now he's taking the kid's father hostage?

00:25:04.367 --> 00:25:08.107
He's pressured by the investigation. We need to put the hostage at ease.

00:25:09.567 --> 00:25:10.577
Darn it!

00:25:23.357 --> 00:25:24.387
Open it up, open it.

00:25:29.457 --> 00:25:32.197
They've cracked the USB password. I got word she's on their way.

00:25:33.997 --> 00:25:34.997
What about Lee Heo Jun?

00:25:38.567 --> 00:25:39.767
Get me some water over here.

00:25:50.047 --> 00:25:51.417
(Hostage-taker: Yun Dong Hee)

00:25:51.777 --> 00:25:55.917
What good is stalling for time? Shouldn't we try to talk to him?

00:25:56.717 --> 00:25:59.717
He's right. I checked his medical records,

00:25:59.787 --> 00:26:03.057
and he's been on strong medication for a long time,

00:26:03.127 --> 00:26:04.857
so if his symptoms flare up while he's off his meds,

00:26:05.627 --> 00:26:07.367
he could become significantly more violent.

00:26:09.497 --> 00:26:12.097
As someone who knows Yun Dong Hee well,

00:26:12.837 --> 00:26:14.037
I should be the one to go in.

00:26:15.407 --> 00:26:17.207
Are you sure about that?

00:26:17.507 --> 00:26:19.277
The longer we wait, the greater the risk for the hostage.

00:26:19.707 --> 00:26:22.777
After I go in and assess his condition,

00:26:23.147 --> 00:26:26.217
may I administer his medication if needed?

00:26:27.847 --> 00:26:31.457
You would know the patient's condition best.

00:26:31.517 --> 00:26:33.087
Yes, go ahead.

00:26:33.557 --> 00:26:35.787
All right, shall we head in?

00:26:36.387 --> 00:26:37.397
Yes.

00:26:38.257 --> 00:26:39.297
Si On, how close are you?

00:26:41.167 --> 00:26:42.197
I'm almost there.

00:26:53.607 --> 00:26:55.377
Hey, Si On! Over here!

00:26:55.447 --> 00:26:57.517
Detective Kang! Just a second, hold on!

00:26:57.577 --> 00:26:59.377
- Excuse us. - Please let us through.

00:27:00.347 --> 00:27:02.187
- You made it. - You have to hurry!

00:27:06.387 --> 00:27:09.387
Detective Kang is on her way. Just stall them a little longer.

00:27:19.897 --> 00:27:21.507
Phone, watch, and all electronic devices.

00:27:21.507 --> 00:27:22.707
You'll have to leave them here.

00:27:23.777 --> 00:27:25.177
It's one of the hostage-taker's demands.

00:27:36.387 --> 00:27:37.757
What's in that bag?

00:27:39.017 --> 00:27:40.657
It's Yun Dong Hee's prescription medication.

00:27:51.937 --> 00:27:54.567
- It's nothing strange, is it? - I've had about enough of you.

00:27:55.407 --> 00:27:56.907
What do you think you're doing?

00:27:57.377 --> 00:28:01.407
To a doctor, of all people. You think you know this just on sight?

00:28:01.647 --> 00:28:02.807
Would you even know?

00:28:04.817 --> 00:28:06.747
- Let's not get carried away. - It's all right.

00:28:06.817 --> 00:28:09.317
Hey, Detective Choi. You need to calm down and come here.

00:28:11.917 --> 00:28:12.917
Please, this way.

00:28:14.887 --> 00:28:15.887
Just a moment.

00:28:20.427 --> 00:28:21.427
What now?

00:28:21.497 --> 00:28:23.027
Hey, hold on. Isn't this going a bit too far?

00:28:23.867 --> 00:28:25.097
This is also part of his demands.

00:28:27.137 --> 00:28:29.537
For crying out loud. You're really trying my patience.

00:28:29.867 --> 00:28:31.307
Let's just humor them, all right?

00:28:40.317 --> 00:28:41.317
Let's go.

00:28:54.927 --> 00:28:56.097
We're heading up!

00:30:46.178 --> 00:30:47.248
You're not the hostage.

00:30:48.078 --> 00:30:50.348
You're the real hostage-taker, aren't you, Shin Jay?

00:30:51.748 --> 00:30:55.158
To fool everyone outside and orchestrate all of this...

00:30:55.918 --> 00:30:57.928
That's not something a sane man could pull off.

00:31:01.798 --> 00:31:03.398
Listening to him talk,

00:31:04.528 --> 00:31:08.638
- you're the crazy one. - Yun Dong Hee is mentally ill.

00:31:09.768 --> 00:31:10.768
And you believe what he says?

00:31:13.068 --> 00:31:14.978
Yun Dong Hee needs treatment right now.

00:31:15.878 --> 00:31:18.608
Let's calm the patient down first.

00:31:28.858 --> 00:31:29.858
Are you okay?

00:31:36.258 --> 00:31:37.528
He's not in good shape.

00:31:37.798 --> 00:31:39.028
I'm going to have to intervene.

00:31:59.748 --> 00:32:02.658
This is what you want as well,

00:32:03.858 --> 00:32:05.458
isn't it?

00:32:06.898 --> 00:32:07.898
Revenge.

00:32:31.518 --> 00:32:32.718
What are you doing?

00:32:35.658 --> 00:32:37.888
You're trying to kill me?

00:32:38.128 --> 00:32:40.698
I did everything you told me to.

00:32:41.558 --> 00:32:44.298
I did everything you told me to do!

00:32:45.098 --> 00:32:46.128
I killed them all.

00:32:46.398 --> 00:32:47.768
I even killed Cha So Yeon,

00:32:48.598 --> 00:32:49.698
and Kim Yong Woo.

00:32:50.708 --> 00:32:52.708
I did everything you told me to do,

00:32:53.268 --> 00:32:55.738
So why are you trying to kill me?

00:32:56.438 --> 00:32:58.378
- I killed them all, didn't I? - I'm heading to HQ.

00:32:59.008 --> 00:33:00.548
I killed them all! But then,

00:33:00.948 --> 00:33:04.188
- you said you'd give me the drugs! - Yun Dong Hee!

00:33:05.688 --> 00:33:06.688
Quiet down.

00:33:07.718 --> 00:33:10.988
- Wait until I'm finished speaking. - But you're the one who said it!

00:33:11.788 --> 00:33:14.528
For killing Han Ji Young and Lee Han Jun,

00:33:15.158 --> 00:33:16.358
when I got caught by the cops,

00:33:16.898 --> 00:33:20.238
you said you'd get me off! You promised diminished capacity!

00:33:20.698 --> 00:33:21.938
That's what you promised!

00:33:22.638 --> 00:33:23.638
For murdering Han Ji Young...

00:33:24.308 --> 00:33:25.308
and Lee Han Jun,

00:33:25.638 --> 00:33:28.678
you said you drugged me to plead diminished capacity!

00:33:28.738 --> 00:33:29.808
That's right, you punk.

00:33:32.378 --> 00:33:34.018
So they wouldn't call you a murderer.

00:33:34.018 --> 00:33:35.248
So you wouldn't get punished.

00:33:35.318 --> 00:33:39.218
Because your mother wanted it. I told you why, you punk!

00:33:42.218 --> 00:33:43.218
Then what about Cha So Yeon?

00:33:43.858 --> 00:33:44.858
And Kim Yong Woo?

00:33:45.488 --> 00:33:47.628
You ordered me to kill all of them.

00:33:48.028 --> 00:33:51.028
I killed them all on your orders! My money!

00:33:51.168 --> 00:33:52.268
Give me my money.

00:33:52.668 --> 00:33:56.298
- Give me my money! - Stop interrupting and shut up!

00:34:03.178 --> 00:34:04.348
That's enough out of you!

00:34:05.908 --> 00:34:06.918
What's your problem?

00:34:07.618 --> 00:34:10.348
- Isn't this what you wanted? - Get up, you punk.

00:34:10.618 --> 00:34:11.618
Get up!

00:34:13.148 --> 00:34:14.158
All right, so...

00:34:14.818 --> 00:34:15.918
what is it that you want?

00:34:17.528 --> 00:34:18.528
The truth.

00:34:18.888 --> 00:34:20.088
The truth about that day.

00:34:21.198 --> 00:34:23.598
If you give me a straight answer to my questions,

00:34:25.228 --> 00:34:27.698
and if that punk Yun Dong Hee lives or die,

00:34:28.338 --> 00:34:29.338
I don't give a darn.

00:34:30.638 --> 00:34:31.638
Why...

00:34:32.438 --> 00:34:33.838
Why did you kill my Jun?

00:34:42.248 --> 00:34:43.418
I did no such thing.

00:34:44.618 --> 00:34:47.218
Look, I didn't even know who you were.

00:34:47.288 --> 00:34:49.758
How could I have known your son, let alone kill him?

00:34:50.758 --> 00:34:53.598
I mean, seriously. Just to find out that one thing,

00:34:54.958 --> 00:34:56.358
you're going to cause this much of a scene?

00:34:58.528 --> 00:34:59.928
Since things have come to this,

00:35:00.338 --> 00:35:01.338
I'll tell you everything.

00:35:09.278 --> 00:35:11.478
I wasn't thinking straight that day...

00:35:14.248 --> 00:35:16.118
because I had to go take care of Kim Yong Woo,

00:35:18.788 --> 00:35:20.818
after dealing with Yun Dong Hee without any complications.

00:35:23.658 --> 00:35:24.658
You see, Kim Yong Woo...

00:35:25.128 --> 00:35:27.158
had taken something very important from me.

00:35:27.228 --> 00:35:30.928
Bring me what Kim Yong Woo stole. Or I'll shoot him.

00:35:32.498 --> 00:35:34.098
You were there too, weren't you?

00:35:35.768 --> 00:35:37.438
(Caller ID Restricted)

00:35:37.438 --> 00:35:39.008
That was the day.

00:35:46.478 --> 00:35:47.648
Come to think of it,

00:35:48.848 --> 00:35:50.718
we're bound by a cruel fate.

00:35:53.118 --> 00:35:54.288
It might be a coincidence,

00:35:55.258 --> 00:35:56.258
but it's a cruel fate.

00:36:06.168 --> 00:36:07.238
Get away from me!

00:36:07.638 --> 00:36:08.998
I'm not crazy!

00:36:16.738 --> 00:36:17.948
(Caller ID Restricted)

00:36:21.678 --> 00:36:24.718
That day, I prescribed a drug to Yun Dong Hee.

00:36:25.388 --> 00:36:26.388
But look.

00:36:27.818 --> 00:36:29.788
I administered the drugs correctly,

00:36:30.758 --> 00:36:32.828
but he still went wild like this.

00:36:33.628 --> 00:36:35.158
He went completely berserk!

00:36:35.898 --> 00:36:38.568
This isn't anyone's fault.

00:36:40.198 --> 00:36:41.198
It was purely...

00:36:42.338 --> 00:36:43.338
an accident.

00:36:44.468 --> 00:36:45.668
Just an accident.

00:36:46.738 --> 00:36:47.778
In this world,

00:36:48.278 --> 00:36:51.348
countless tragic things like this happen all the time.

00:36:52.008 --> 00:36:54.448
Buildings collapse, sinkholes open up,

00:36:54.518 --> 00:36:55.978
car accidents happen.

00:37:01.518 --> 00:37:02.888
What was the baby's name again?

00:37:04.728 --> 00:37:05.728
Right.

00:37:06.228 --> 00:37:07.298
Shin Jun.

00:37:08.928 --> 00:37:10.058
He just...

00:37:10.728 --> 00:37:14.068
met with one of those accidents, that's all.

00:37:15.498 --> 00:37:17.308
It wasn't a problem with Dong Hee's prescription.

00:37:17.738 --> 00:37:20.408
It was just an accident. An accident, I tell you.

00:37:20.508 --> 00:37:21.508
Just...

00:37:23.078 --> 00:37:24.078
You son of a...

00:37:25.008 --> 00:37:26.008
"Just"?

00:37:26.478 --> 00:37:27.478
"Just"?

00:37:28.078 --> 00:37:29.578
A "tragic thing"?

00:37:29.948 --> 00:37:32.148
My entire world came crashing down.

00:37:32.948 --> 00:37:33.958
"Just"?

00:37:35.758 --> 00:37:36.758
"Just"?

00:37:39.258 --> 00:37:41.398
Answer me, you punk!

00:37:47.768 --> 00:37:48.768
Move in.

00:38:09.118 --> 00:38:10.428
Yes, we're securing him now.

00:38:10.428 --> 00:38:12.458
- Yes, right now. - Commissioner, we're all set.

00:38:13.488 --> 00:38:14.498
Yes.

00:38:33.718 --> 00:38:34.718
Si On.

00:38:36.648 --> 00:38:39.248
It's okay. Mr. Shin will be all right.

00:39:37.648 --> 00:39:39.978
(Sunshine Daycare)

00:39:41.678 --> 00:39:43.848
- Please be thorough. - Understood.

00:39:48.618 --> 00:39:49.688
Find anything?

00:39:49.758 --> 00:39:51.858
Yes, we got a fingerprint from the second one.

00:39:55.028 --> 00:39:57.528
("My Face" by Yun Dong Hee)

00:40:02.438 --> 00:40:03.438
Here.

00:40:03.838 --> 00:40:06.708
- Process this first, and hurry. - Yes, sir. Right away.

00:40:07.678 --> 00:40:09.708
(Gyeonggi Bukbu Provincial Police Agency)

00:40:52.548 --> 00:40:53.788
Move it, move it!

00:40:57.528 --> 00:41:00.558
- Check everything, trash cans too. - Yes, sir!

00:41:26.018 --> 00:41:27.018
Sir.

00:41:32.658 --> 00:41:34.558
We will now begin the press briefing...

00:41:34.628 --> 00:41:38.168
on yesterday's hostage situation involving Yun Dong Hee.

00:41:38.728 --> 00:41:42.138
Since Yun Dong Hee's escape from the medical center a month ago,

00:41:42.438 --> 00:41:45.168
Gyeonggi Bukbu Detective Task Force...

00:41:45.238 --> 00:41:50.008
launched a special investigation to apprehend him.

00:41:50.478 --> 00:41:52.648
During our investigation, we found evidence that Yun Dong Hee...

00:41:52.778 --> 00:41:57.718
was part of a murder-for-hire plot. In order to identify the mastermind,

00:41:57.818 --> 00:42:00.048
we expanded the scope of our investigation,

00:42:00.148 --> 00:42:03.118
concurrently, we began tracking Yun Dong Hee's movements...

00:42:03.318 --> 00:42:06.428
and his potential hideouts.

00:42:06.558 --> 00:42:10.768
Furthermore, we have arrested the man who tried to kill Yun.

00:42:10.868 --> 00:42:13.968
It's Lee Heo Jun, the director of the Federal Medical Center.

00:42:14.438 --> 00:42:16.998
He's charged with four more counts of soliciting murder...

00:42:17.068 --> 00:42:19.768
and taken into emergency custody at the scene.

00:42:19.868 --> 00:42:21.078
(Chicken Center)

00:42:21.938 --> 00:42:24.248
I was a nervous wreck during that whole briefing.

00:42:24.578 --> 00:42:26.578
You were good. You didn't even blink.

00:42:26.878 --> 00:42:27.878
What was that?

00:42:28.148 --> 00:42:30.118
Nothing. Just that the camera loves you.

00:42:30.318 --> 00:42:31.588
It always has.

00:42:32.888 --> 00:42:36.058
Entrapment? How rediculous!

00:42:36.288 --> 00:42:38.888
You pulled a fast one on the nation, and you call it "entrapment"?

00:42:39.028 --> 00:42:43.098
But we caught the bad guy. How else could we catch the punk?

00:42:43.158 --> 00:42:46.298
- Please, just stop. - Listen to him brag. Unbelievable.

00:42:46.368 --> 00:42:48.138
But catching the bad guy is a good thing, right?

00:42:49.598 --> 00:42:51.568
He runs the Federal Medical Center.

00:42:51.668 --> 00:42:55.008
If you fail to get a conviction, be prepared to turn in your badges!

00:42:55.208 --> 00:42:56.208
And if we do?

00:42:56.538 --> 00:42:58.208
You'll drop charges on Mr. Shin, won't you?

00:42:58.278 --> 00:42:59.348
I don't know.

00:42:59.948 --> 00:43:00.948
Get out!

00:43:01.378 --> 00:43:02.378
Yes, sir.

00:43:02.848 --> 00:43:04.588
- Let's go. Let's get out of here. - Okay.

00:43:04.648 --> 00:43:07.918
What choice is there? He's guilty.

00:43:08.818 --> 00:43:09.958
Just go, man.

00:43:12.088 --> 00:43:13.158
This is Kang Yeo Gyeong.

00:43:14.828 --> 00:43:16.498
- Yes. - Hey, Jung Hwan.

00:43:17.258 --> 00:43:19.298
We have to get the charges against Mr. Shin dropped.

00:43:19.928 --> 00:43:22.298
We wouldn't have caught Lee Heo Jun without him.

00:43:22.568 --> 00:43:25.938
I'll do whatever it takes. I'll prove Lee Heo Jun's guilt.

00:43:26.008 --> 00:43:27.678
- About that... - I know.

00:43:28.008 --> 00:43:29.608
You've done enough, man.

00:43:31.448 --> 00:43:33.078
Let's get back to work, all right?

00:43:33.578 --> 00:43:35.678
Hey. Do me a favor.

00:43:35.748 --> 00:43:37.548
- Okay? - Understood.

00:43:39.088 --> 00:43:41.358
Sir. The injection results are in.

00:43:43.188 --> 00:43:45.888
The cap on the vial says "Vanoxin," but...

00:43:46.328 --> 00:43:48.728
the contents are KCL.

00:43:49.058 --> 00:43:50.298
Potassium chloride.

00:43:50.928 --> 00:43:54.098
In other countries, it's used in lethal injections.

00:43:54.898 --> 00:43:56.898
Just 10ml is enough to stop a heart.

- Pour me one, too. - Sure.

00:45:51.188 --> 00:45:52.188
I'll have one, too.

00:45:52.918 --> 00:45:54.388
- Hello. - Hello.

00:45:55.618 --> 00:45:57.788
- Here it is. - I'll pour you the drink.

00:45:59.858 --> 00:46:01.358
Hey, everyone.

00:46:01.928 --> 00:46:03.898
What is this? A funeral?

00:46:03.958 --> 00:46:07.028
Come on, let's make a toast. Hey, Pillip, pour me one, too.

00:46:09.898 --> 00:46:11.208
Here, drink up.

00:46:13.038 --> 00:46:14.978
- Thank you. - You too, Pillip.

00:46:15.438 --> 00:46:16.478
Here you go.

00:46:18.278 --> 00:46:19.478
Who... Who are you?

00:46:19.548 --> 00:46:22.278
He's the one who cracked the USB.

00:46:22.418 --> 00:46:24.848
Right. Hello, I'm Choi Cheol.

00:46:24.918 --> 00:46:27.558
Detective! A pleasure. I'm Kim Su Dong.

00:46:27.618 --> 00:46:30.188
It's a pleasure to meet you. Let me pour you a drink.

00:46:30.418 --> 00:46:32.028
Your name doesn't really suit you.

00:46:32.088 --> 00:46:36.728
Hey! Live up to your name. I used to be a very passive guy,

00:46:36.858 --> 00:46:40.198
But Mr. Shin got me involved in everything.

00:46:40.198 --> 00:46:41.238
Here, drink up.

00:46:43.238 --> 00:46:44.938
All right. Let's make a toast.

00:46:45.608 --> 00:46:48.238
We didn't say no!

00:46:48.408 --> 00:46:50.708
We went with the flow!

00:46:50.878 --> 00:46:54.948
And we got the culprit! To you-know-what!

00:46:55.018 --> 00:46:56.548
Yes, to you-know-what...

00:46:57.448 --> 00:46:58.448
You-know-what, you-know-what...

00:46:58.518 --> 00:47:00.718
It sounds little strange. To you-know-what!

00:47:00.788 --> 00:47:02.118
To you-know-what!

00:47:08.258 --> 00:47:10.658
- Hey, don't we have any snacks? - Should I fry up some chicken?

00:47:10.798 --> 00:47:12.698
No, don't bother.

00:47:13.228 --> 00:47:17.398
Only Mr. Shin makes good chicken.

00:47:19.108 --> 00:47:21.908
- I miss him. - That's a shame.

I've never had his chicken before.

00:47:24.778 --> 00:47:26.078
It's seriously the best.

00:47:27.148 --> 00:47:28.848
Still, we should have something to munch on.

00:47:30.148 --> 00:47:32.218
- Should I grab some chips? - Yes, we need something.

00:47:35.918 --> 00:47:36.918
May I ask what year you were born?

00:47:37.018 --> 00:47:39.158
Yes. I was born in 1966.

00:47:39.658 --> 00:47:41.058
- How old are you? - So you're my senior.

00:47:41.128 --> 00:47:42.128
Stop it.

00:47:42.328 --> 00:47:43.628
You're a handsome guy.

00:47:58.878 --> 00:47:59.878
This is heavy.

Goodness.

00:48:05.148 --> 00:48:09.988
It's a lot. There's chocolate milk, pig's feet, and porridge.

That's why I'm still helping you all these years later.

you must never threaten or provoke the hostage-taker.

When did I provoke them?

"However, there is one condition. I'll be the one calling the shots."

00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:38.540
Giving orders, demanding, judging, or insulting the hostage-taker,

00:54:38.610 --> 00:54:40.140
those four things are the cardinal sins.

Your technical skills were garbage,

00:54:55.290 --> 00:54:56.760
your sincerity got through.

Your determination to save me at all costs.

00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:06.930
I felt that, and it moved me.

00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:10.100
So that's a compliment, right?

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:17.040
You drank a ton of booze last night from the fridge, didn't you?

00:55:18.110 --> 00:55:21.380
Officer Kim said it was a reward for solving the code,

00:55:21.450 --> 00:55:22.480

Here you go. Your coffee.

00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:11.030
Time to get back to your real job, right?

00:56:11.130 --> 00:56:14.770
Real job, my foot. This chicken joint is my real job.

00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:17.500
It's a silly suit against a small business.

00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:19.740
It's simple, so let's end this fast.

00:56:19.810 --> 00:56:21.140
No way.

00:56:21.410 --> 00:56:25.950
Our task force is up for review, and we're a little short on cases.

00:56:26.010 --> 00:56:28.280
- It's urgent. - What task force?

00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:29.880
The Conflict Resolution Task Force.

00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:33.750
A department the Court should've had ages ago.

00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:36.760
Wait, if that department should belong to the Court,

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:39.730
why being set up in a chicken joint of all places?

00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:42.700
What is this?

00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:48.270
It said it'd refresh your very soul, so I drank it.

00:56:48.370 --> 00:56:51.810
"My soul doesn't feel refreshed?" This is insane.

00:56:52.610 --> 00:56:55.210
Right? Even you think it's crazy, Mr. Shin?

00:56:55.610 --> 00:56:59.310
Can we let this drag on for a year? Settle it by the end of the week.

00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:02.680
- It's urgent. I'm leaving. - Hey, who said I'd do it?

00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:05.590
Call me when you're done. It's urgent.

00:57:05.590 --> 00:57:09.390
Hey, you can't just leave. To move forward, I need some cash...

00:57:09.390 --> 00:57:11.360
- Go on inside. - Yes.

00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:12.560
Darn it.

00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:16.060
Just my luck. Always ending up like this.

00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:19.670
I swear, this job is going to be the death of me.

00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:22.900
So what does "refreshing down to your soul" even mean?

00:57:22.970 --> 00:57:26.010
How should I know? It's just one thing after another.

00:57:26.070 --> 00:57:27.870
Even buying and selling souls.

00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:30.140
It's just chaos these days, total chaos.

00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:32.980
Hold on a second.

00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:36.020
I was dying for some action anyway.

00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:39.220
I'll strip this punk down to their soul...

00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:41.690
and give them a refreshing send-off.

00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:43.460
- Mr. Shin. - What?

00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:45.560
This time,

00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:47.430
let me handle it.

00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:52.770
What are the four taboos again?

00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:57.840
Commands, conditions, judgments...

00:57:59.170 --> 00:58:00.470
And insults!

00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:08.980
Show them what you've got!

00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:15.190

(Epilogue)

00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:39.080
I felt like...

00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:41.650
I should at least pray from afar,

00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:44.380
so I'd come by sometimes,

00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:47.090
and I'd pay my respects on the anniversary of his death.

01:00:08.570 --> 01:00:09.870
Go on, go to bed.

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.540
All right, all right.

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:17.610
Okay.

01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:28.920
Say Dada. Come on, Dada.

01:00:28.990 --> 01:00:31.420
That's it. Yes, that's my boy.

01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:32.730
Dada.

01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:34.460

Pick your favorite one from here.

That's it!

01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:47.140
We'll play catch together. Just you wait a little.

01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:48.880
Your daddy's always working, and can't even play catch with you.

01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:49.940
Hey, honey.

Jun.

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:54.110
Tell your dad to finish up and come play.

01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:57.680
- Daddy, hurry up and come play. - Okay, okay, I'm coming, Jun.

- What's this? - Mommy's amazing, right?

01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:01.290
How'd you do that?

01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:03.390
Ready!

01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:05.830
Go!

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:08.200

01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:17.500
Wow, Jun, you're The Boss!

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:18.710
Hey, Jun.

01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:21.710
- Bye. Have a good day. - You're coming to get me, right?

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:25.310
Of course. I promise I'll come get you later.

01:01:26.110 --> 01:01:28.250
Be safe. Bye-bye.

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:29.720
- Bye-bye! - Bye.

01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:30.780
Let's go.

01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:33.550
Say bye-bye to Daddy one more time.

01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:36.060
Bye, Jun! Have a great time!

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:11.320
(Shin's Project)

01:02:11.590 --> 01:02:14.090
Hey, everyone. I'm getting married!

01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:17.760
You never know till you say 'I do.'

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:19.230
Come on, knock it off.

01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:22.370
- Looks like you have to step in. - All right. I'll give it to them.

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:26.610
- Pretty cool, right? - And just like that, you passed.

01:02:26.810 --> 01:02:31.210
Believing only a severely ill person and framing me as a criminal...

01:02:31.310 --> 01:02:32.710
is a criminal act itself.

01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:36.020
The Shin's Project. You do what you do best,

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:38.180
and Judge Cho does what he does best.

01:02:38.690 --> 01:02:40.320
Get ready!
