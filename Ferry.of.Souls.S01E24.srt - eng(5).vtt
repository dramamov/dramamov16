00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.800
I've been plotting for a thousand years.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.840
As long as I eliminate

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.300
all you innkeepers today,

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.200
the monster inn will disappear.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.000
I will regain my freedom.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.440
Shangguan Feiye,

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:56.680
Dongfang Zhaobai,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.280
all of you can die!

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.560
Ling Po,

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.300
you're celebrating too soon.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.320
I almost forgot

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.040
about you.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.840
Didn't you break ties with him?

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.640
You even planted the Wujian Vine on him.

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.440
You wanted him to take Shangguan Feiye's place

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.040
and die from the karmic fire.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.500
I was indeed deceived by you at first.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.440
I mistakenly thought Shangguan Feiye killed my brother.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.050
But later I remembered something.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.520
It was you who told me

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.880
that evil spirits appeared in Shangguan Feiye's village.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.880
You sent me to catch those monsters.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.640
You wanted her to misunderstand

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.240
that I was Dongfang Zhaobai.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.040
That I killed her loved ones.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.120
Then use her to eliminate my brother.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.240
It seems

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.560
you're not as stupid as I thought.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.800
But aren't you afraid your brother

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.400
might actually die from the Wujian Vine

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.800
filled with karmic fire?

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.680
How did the Wujian Vine end up on you?

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.020
My brother and I

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.520
are incarnations of the Huangquan Jade.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.380
The Wujian Vine

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.220
connects the two jade pieces.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.079
They can naturally be transferred between us.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.200
Karmic fire!

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.010
So what if it's a different person?

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.120
Besides,

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.960
now you bear the power of karmic fire.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.480
You'll soon be reduced to ashes.

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.560
What can you possibly do?

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.930
It was all just an illusion to deceive you.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.960
When you thought my brother

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.560
was completely controlled by the Wujian Vine,

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.520
I transferred it to myself.

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:51.680
Of course,

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.930
I was also gambling.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.620
Betting that Shangguan Feiye

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.980
would risk her life

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.300
to return to a thousand years ago.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.120
So what?

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.160
You're only half of the Huangquan Jade.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.660
Now you bear the power of karmic fire.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.680
You'll soon be reduced to ashes.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.880
As for those two,

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.519
they're not even worth mentioning.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.959
Is that so?

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.960
Today is the day you die.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.640
Prepare to meet your end.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:10.720
Qiongqi.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.360
The Huangquan Jade can only be restored

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.610
to its original power when the two pieces are united.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.880
Only then can we stop the Demon King.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.740
Please be careful.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.620
Wait for my return.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.720
I'm back.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.200
From today onwards,

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.080
you belong to me.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:42.640
Feiye.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:44.480
Feiye.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:46.520
Is anybody there?

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.520
Help me!

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:57.960
Let the past

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.240
be the past.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:01.960
In the days ahead,

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.090
take good care of yourself.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.760
Hey, the boss is back.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:54.960
Boss,

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.640
you're up early today.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.840
You look very nice today.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.000
Boss.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:05.800
Boss.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.400
Boss.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:08.840
Boss.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.410
Good morning, boss.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:11.200
Boss,

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.450
at your service!

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:15.960
Hello, boss.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.360
All right.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.240
Boss,

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:20.880
try this that I made.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:21.360
Boss.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.000
What's wrong?

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:25.800
What happened? Who ate it?

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.200
It was you.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:26.840
Which eye of yours saw me eating it?

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:27.400
I saw everything.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.480
Do you have any proof?

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:28.920
Oh my!

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:29.960
Where's my knife?

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.560
Dongfang.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:31.880
Oh, Boss, look at her!

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:32.210
Look!

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:33.960
Let go of me!

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:34.640
It was you.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.240
Hey, stop fighting, you two!

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.220
The boss will be back soon.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:38.920
Well,

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.650
I need to fix this rabbit lantern quickly.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.260
This is Feiye's

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.480
most treasured gift.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.000
Dongfang.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:56.720
Dongfang.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:18.360
Boss.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.060
Stop drinking.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:28.720
Dongfang,

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.530
you're back.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:37.560
Boss,

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.800
sneaking food again?

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:48.160
Dongfang.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:52.480
Dongfang.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.440
Are you really gone?

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.560
Will you never come back?

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.400
That's the end of the Monster Inn story.

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.610
Does the Monster Inn from the story

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.840
really exist?

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.160
It's just a story.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.880
There are no monsters in this world,

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.580
so naturally there's no Monster Inn.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.090
So-called monsters

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.400
are merely

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.320
people trapped by obsessions in their hearts.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:19.520
Obsessions.
