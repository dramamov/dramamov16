00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.600
This place again.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.880
Who is she?

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.640
Why do you want to kill me?

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.930
Another nightmare?

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.410
I still couldn't see the bride's face.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.620
If this continues,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.160
I'm going to lose my mind.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.370
Don't worry.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.020
Have some water first.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.620
This is a normal reaction to extreme stress.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.720
It's hard to distinguish between fantasy and reality.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.320
How can I get rid of them completely?

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.320
As long as you stay here and continue treatment,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.600
Oh no.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.000
everything will be fine.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.539
It's Yiyi's birthday.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.080
Hello.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.570
The number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.400
That dress just now was really beautiful.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.160
I like it.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.000
Dongfang.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.490
What a coincidence.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
What are you doing?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.840
What do you mean?

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.039
We're good brothers.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.700
You clearly know I've always liked Yiyi.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.200
I thought you

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.760
were always obsessing over that stupid dream

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.000
about the inn

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.760
and the faceless bride.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.560
I thought you'd freed yourself from worldly desires,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.680
so why are you still hung up on these mundane matters?

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.199
Stop changing the subject.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.060
I know all about

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.880
your affairs.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.000
I'm asking you:

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.680
Are you serious about Liu Yiyi?

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.760
Oh my God,

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.560
bro.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.079
When have I not been serious about women?

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:20.400
With women,

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.610
you need to shower them with money.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.970
From now on, you'll work for me.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.320
Let me go!

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.400
Get him!

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.600
Let me go!

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.250
Have you mistaken me for someone else?

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.380
Dongfang Zhaobai.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.660
How do you know my name?

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.050
From today onwards,

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.480
you belong to me.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.680
I'll train you well.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.900
You were just lecturing me

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.010
but you're the one who hooked up with a rich woman.

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.240
I have a bad temper.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.610
I don't like repeating myself.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.000
So listen carefully.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.360
Dongfang Zhaobai is with me,

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.650
and if you dare bully him again,

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.120
they

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.640
won't be as polite as I am.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.880
Stay back!

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.680
Who are you?

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.240
Where are you taking me?

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.600
To where you belong.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.860
Thanks for your help just now.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.060
From now on,

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.840
you'll be my personal driver,

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.600
work secretary,

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.000
and personal assistant.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.180
In other words,

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.640
a servant.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.640
Servant.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.240
No.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.610
This makes no sense.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.640
Who are you anyway?

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.970
Where are you taking me?

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.800
Monster Inn.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.880
Kill me.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.160
Do it.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.920
Kill him.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.320
He's the real culprit.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.440
Kill him.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.840
Welcome to the Monster Inn.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.580
Who are you really?

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.760
I'm the innkeeper here,

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.680
Shangguan Feiye.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.120
Could it be

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.890
she's the one who killed me in my dream?

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.440
You're awake.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.720
Don't come any closer!

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.580
That one is from the Qing Dynasty,

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.780
and that's from the Song Dynasty.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.080
I helped you.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.930
It's fine if you don't thank me,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.160
but why?

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.090
You still want to hit me?

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.820
Are you human or demon?

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.640
What exactly do you want from me?

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.280
Do you really want to know?

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:35.880
Of course.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.159
I am not a demon.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.760
But I'm not human either.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.320
All these years,

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.500
I've been looking for you.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:48.820
Looking for me?

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.400
To be precise,

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.480
I'm finding a suitable employee for the Demon Inn.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.680
And that person

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.800
is you.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.680
What exactly do you want me to do?

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.280
The job is simple.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.000
Our inn

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.880
helps people resolve their inner obsessions.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.800
However,

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.400
these guests are not ordinary people.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.240
I'm sorry,

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.760
but I'm just an ordinary person.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.690
I need to go home.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.120
If you stay here,

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.800
I'll treat you well.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.250
But if you still want to run away...

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.120
I won't run.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:29.850
Absolutely not.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.020
Do you need me to open the door for you?

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.320
What are you thinking? You can't run after coming to the Monster Inn.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:01.320
Monster.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:13.450
I'm done.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.160
I messed up.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.360
Stop wasting time!

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.090
Go tell the innkeeper quickly!

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.080
Come give me a hand.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:56.800
Old lady.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:57.640
I stay up late all the time

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.520
and have osteoporosis.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.200
I'm not suitable to be turned into a flower.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.660
You were brought here by Feiye, weren't you?

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.600
Who are you?

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.840
You can be like the others

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.800
and call me Granny Ling.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:11.490
Granny Ling.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.040
Don't be afraid.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.920
I'm just

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.720
an old woman who takes care of these lovely plants.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.000
These flowers are quite lovely.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.880
All I can do

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.800
is loosen the soil

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.920
and water them.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.040
As for whether they can grow

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:37.920
and bloom,

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.810
that depends on whether they're willing to let go of their obsessions.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.440
You don't believe me?

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.960
No, no, not at all.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.890
How could I not believe you?

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.040
Oh, right.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.200
That woman told me

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.280
this is a Monster Inn,

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.840
a place that helps monsters resolve their obsessions.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.900
Do these plants have obsessions too?

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.000
Monsters are just

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.460
people trapped by their obsessions.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.120
In this world,

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.360
flowers, birds, fish, insects,

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.200
all creatures

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.960
can form attachments.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.560
When these attachments remain unresolved,

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.600
naturally,

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.740
obsessions form in their hearts.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:25.400
Well,

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.240
I came here by mistake,

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.420
so I won't bother you anymore.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.600
Isn't there someone you've been avoiding?

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.360
What's the matter?

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.480
Those who can find their way

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.760
to the Monster Inn are destined to be here.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.620
Either with unfulfilled wishes,

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.320
or lingering attachments.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:46.720
Running away

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.960
will never solve your problems.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:53.560
Goodbye.
