Whenever a couple gets together,

00:00:29.675 --> 00:00:32.465
there's one question they're almost always asked.

00:00:32.675 --> 00:00:33.675
And that is,

00:00:34.065 --> 00:00:35.405
"How did you two meet and fall in love?"

00:00:35.895 --> 00:00:36.915
Hey, hey!

00:00:37.585 --> 00:00:38.895
So when did you two officially start dating?

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:43.205
Well... about two weeks ago...

00:00:43.475 --> 00:00:46.425
Hey, it was two weeks and two days ago.

00:00:46.505 --> 00:00:49.325
- Oh, right.
- The details matter.

00:00:50.405 --> 00:00:52.235
Close enough.

00:00:53.585 --> 00:00:54.585
And then what?

00:00:54.925 --> 00:00:57.015
How did it happen?

00:00:57.595 --> 00:00:58.595
Well,

00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:00.045
that day,

00:01:00.465 --> 00:01:01.465
I...

00:01:01.545 --> 00:01:02.955
forgot my umbrella.

00:01:03.305 --> 00:01:05.525
And I happened to have one.

00:01:10.565 --> 00:01:11.565
What's wrong?

00:01:13.645 --> 00:01:16.035
I forgot my umbrella.

00:01:16.325 --> 00:01:17.325
Oh, I see.

00:01:19.635 --> 00:01:20.635
Here.

00:01:21.265 --> 00:01:22.295
Take this one.

00:01:23.195 --> 00:01:24.195
Huh?

00:01:24.425 --> 00:01:25.425
Are you sure?

00:01:26.175 --> 00:01:27.465
I've got this bigger one for myself.

00:01:35.605 --> 00:01:36.705
Don't you want it?

00:01:38.885 --> 00:01:39.985
It's not that.

00:01:41.115 --> 00:01:42.115
I just...

00:01:43.175 --> 00:01:44.375
I'd rather have that one.

00:01:44.635 --> 00:01:45.635
Huh?

00:01:48.285 --> 00:01:49.485
I'd rather...

00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:53.495
share that one with you.

00:01:55.335 --> 00:01:56.335
Mizuta...

00:02:25.085 --> 00:02:26.185
You'll get wet.

00:02:26.635 --> 00:02:27.735
Come a little closer.

00:02:28.965 --> 00:02:29.965
Okay.

00:02:37.235 --> 00:02:38.235
You...

00:02:38.865 --> 00:02:40.365
smell really nice.

00:02:41.255 --> 00:02:42.255
So do you.

00:02:43.765 --> 00:02:45.125
You smell nice too.

00:02:58.515 --> 00:02:59.435
Wow, so forward.

00:02:59.435 --> 00:03:00.695
How romantic!

00:03:00.695 --> 00:03:02.035
Oh, shut up.

00:03:06.795 --> 00:03:10.315
That's a very wholesome "how we met" story.

00:03:11.035 --> 00:03:12.695
But...

00:03:13.315 --> 00:03:15.705
in this world of BL,

00:03:15.885 --> 00:03:19.165
not all meet-cutes are this wholesome.

Hey, wanna come over for a drink later?

00:04:39.135 --> 00:04:40.135
Sounds good.

00:04:40.415 --> 00:04:41.415
Let's go.

00:04:42.295 --> 00:04:43.495
You guys coming too?

00:04:43.745 --> 00:04:44.745
Oh.

00:04:45.085 --> 00:04:46.085
Then I guess I'll...

00:04:46.515 --> 00:04:47.935
What should I do...?

00:04:48.265 --> 00:04:49.615
I guess I'll go too.

00:04:54.845 --> 00:04:56.925
Oh, it's raining...

00:04:58.425 --> 00:04:59.425
Sorry.

00:04:59.495 --> 00:05:00.695
I'm gonna skip.

00:05:04.885 --> 00:05:06.095
Oh, right.

00:05:06.395 --> 00:05:07.825
I have other plans anyway.

00:05:08.335 --> 00:05:09.825
Oh.

00:05:09.965 --> 00:05:10.965
Okay, then.

00:05:11.325 --> 00:05:12.325
See you.

00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:18.025
You know, those two...

00:05:18.365 --> 00:05:21.015
tend to disappear at the same time.

00:05:22.445 --> 00:05:24.375
You don't think they're secretly dating, do you?

00:05:26.475 --> 00:05:28.385
Those two are probably...

00:05:29.045 --> 00:05:30.265
more than friends,

00:05:30.615 --> 00:05:32.765
but not quite lovers.

00:05:34.015 --> 00:05:35.115
And...

00:05:51.495 --> 00:05:53.135
between them...

00:05:53.335 --> 00:05:55.335
things have already gotten physical.

00:06:11.595 --> 00:06:14.595
You've always wanted this, haven't you?

00:06:15.605 --> 00:06:18.855
But... the rain just wouldn't come.

00:06:19.225 --> 00:06:20.845
I made it rain today.

00:06:25.765 --> 00:06:27.165
That's how badly I wanted you...

00:06:28.095 --> 00:06:29.095
Joji...

00:06:31.405 --> 00:06:32.885
Right now, the two of them...

00:06:33.125 --> 00:06:34.355
are friends with benefits.

00:06:34.945 --> 00:06:35.945
That's right.

00:06:36.535 --> 00:06:37.745
In this world,

00:06:38.095 --> 00:06:42.235
a surprising number of relationships start with sex.

00:06:46.035 --> 00:06:47.865
The phrase "it's raining"...

00:06:48.565 --> 00:06:50.185
is actually their code...

00:06:50.605 --> 00:06:55.185
for "let's hook up later."

00:06:56.885 --> 00:07:00.195
So every beginning for them starts with rain.

00:07:05.735 --> 00:07:06.735
However...

00:07:06.975 --> 00:07:08.845
this is the world of BL.

00:07:10.095 --> 00:07:13.145
All roads eventually lead to BL.

00:07:13.755 --> 00:07:14.755
In other words,

00:07:14.895 --> 00:07:16.345
two people who are just friends with benefits...

00:07:16.345 --> 00:07:18.835
won't stay that way for long.

00:07:20.745 --> 00:07:21.745
Wait, what?

00:07:21.975 --> 00:07:23.895
You two are dating now?

00:07:24.245 --> 00:07:25.245
Yeah.

00:07:25.665 --> 00:07:27.935
Sorry to spring this on you.

00:07:28.115 --> 00:07:29.115
It's probably a shock, right?

00:07:29.795 --> 00:07:33.985
But we didn't want to lie about our relationship.

00:07:41.325 --> 00:07:42.605
We're not shocked at all.

00:07:44.425 --> 00:07:46.005
Thanks for telling us.

00:07:46.245 --> 00:07:47.055
Huh?

00:07:47.335 --> 00:07:48.335
Right?

00:07:48.455 --> 00:07:49.455
Yeah.

00:07:51.085 --> 00:07:52.085
Thank you.

00:07:53.685 --> 00:07:54.685
Congratulations.

00:07:54.905 --> 00:07:55.905
Congrats.

00:08:02.575 --> 00:08:03.675
In a situation like this,

00:08:03.735 --> 00:08:05.895
it's fine to congratulate them.

00:08:06.595 --> 00:08:08.075
Wait, by the way,

00:08:08.535 --> 00:08:11.025
how did you two get together?

00:08:11.445 --> 00:08:11.905
Huh?

00:08:12.685 --> 00:08:14.265
- How it started?
- Yeah, yeah!

00:08:14.395 --> 00:08:15.805
Tell us your "how we met" story.

00:08:17.055 --> 00:08:18.475
"How we met" was...

00:08:19.455 --> 00:08:22.435
we both got drunk at a party,

00:08:24.485 --> 00:08:28.105
and one thing led to another.

00:08:29.085 --> 00:08:30.285
How can they possibly say that out loud?

00:08:31.105 --> 00:08:33.865
Uh, well...

00:08:35.075 --> 00:08:38.805
Well, one time in class,
I happened to be sitting next to Joji.

00:08:39.245 --> 00:08:40.785
Oh, yeah, and then...

00:08:40.875 --> 00:08:42.525
I dropped my eraser,

00:08:42.595 --> 00:08:44.295
and Manabu picked it up for me.

00:08:44.965 --> 00:08:47.385
Wow, talk about a clichÃ© way to meet.

00:08:47.795 --> 00:08:48.795
That's so romantic!

00:08:49.875 --> 00:08:52.065
Oh, come on, it wasn't.

00:08:54.055 --> 00:08:55.595
What a terrible lie.

00:08:56.575 --> 00:08:58.085
Just like those two,

00:08:58.535 --> 00:09:00.795
to avoid being put on the spot later,

00:09:01.375 --> 00:09:03.765
a couple that's still just friends with benefits...

00:09:04.335 --> 00:09:07.135
should prepare a plausible
"how we met" story in advance.

00:09:10.695 --> 00:09:11.905
And so, one day...

00:09:14.685 --> 00:09:15.685
Mmm.

00:09:15.955 --> 00:09:17.485
This pudding is so good.

00:09:17.995 --> 00:09:20.315
I should bring some to Tojo next time.

00:09:20.795 --> 00:09:21.795
Tojo.

00:09:22.435 --> 00:09:23.435
Lord of the Roses.

00:09:27.255 --> 00:09:28.255
Hey there.

00:09:28.705 --> 00:09:29.705
Ayato.

00:09:30.125 --> 00:09:31.125
Bro.

00:09:33.405 --> 00:09:34.405
Hey, Ayato.

00:09:34.735 --> 00:09:35.735
Yeah?

00:09:36.165 --> 00:09:37.165
By the way,

00:09:37.565 --> 00:09:40.555
how exactly did you and Tojo get together?

00:09:42.425 --> 00:09:43.625
How we met?

00:09:44.135 --> 00:09:45.135
Yeah.

00:09:47.005 --> 00:09:48.285
Well...

00:09:48.945 --> 00:09:50.145
Um...

00:09:51.115 --> 00:09:52.115
Hmm...

00:09:53.835 --> 00:09:55.475
What's wrong, little bro?

00:09:56.165 --> 00:09:57.795
You were just smiling so brightly

00:09:57.845 --> 00:10:00.895
while eating that pudding a moment ago.

00:10:01.245 --> 00:10:03.325
Why are you suddenly so hesitant?

00:10:05.815 --> 00:10:06.845
Don't tell me...

00:10:07.255 --> 00:10:09.445
the way Tojo and Ayato met was...

00:10:13.875 --> 00:10:14.875
Huh?

00:10:17.305 --> 00:10:18.305
It's fine, isn't it?

00:10:18.445 --> 00:10:19.445
Ayato.

00:10:20.815 --> 00:10:22.245
No, not here...

00:10:23.085 --> 00:10:24.605
What if someone sees us?

00:10:25.635 --> 00:10:27.755
But you said it was okay last time.

00:10:28.755 --> 00:10:30.925
That was a moment of weakness...

00:10:32.165 --> 00:10:33.165
Hey, Tojo.

00:10:33.705 --> 00:10:34.705
Yeah?

00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:37.945
Do you actually...

00:10:38.965 --> 00:10:40.635
like me for me?

00:10:41.805 --> 00:10:42.805
Or...

00:10:43.415 --> 00:10:44.925
do you just want my body?

00:10:48.865 --> 00:10:49.865
Does it really...

00:10:50.695 --> 00:10:51.985
make a difference?

00:11:02.195 --> 00:11:03.195
Don't tell me...

00:11:03.435 --> 00:11:04.855
the way they got together...

00:11:10.995 --> 00:11:15.195
was through a... physical... relationship...

00:11:19.405 --> 00:11:20.415
Coming.

00:11:27.805 --> 00:11:29.175
Sorry to intrude.

00:11:31.555 --> 00:11:32.815
Oh, bro.

00:11:34.775 --> 00:11:35.775
What's gotten into you?

00:11:36.535 --> 00:11:37.635
This guy...

00:11:38.285 --> 00:11:41.175
Beneath that sweet, gentle face...

00:11:41.345 --> 00:11:44.215
lurks the instinct of a wild beast.

00:11:44.235 --> 00:11:46.075
Oh, sorry.

00:11:46.075 --> 00:11:47.255
Looks like I brought the same thing...

00:11:47.255 --> 00:11:48.685
It's a little something for you.

00:11:49.205 --> 00:11:50.205
A gift?

00:11:55.785 --> 00:11:56.275
Oh!

00:11:56.675 --> 00:11:57.455
Wow!

00:11:57.455 --> 00:11:59.215
Not at all. I'm so happy I get to eat more pudding.

00:11:59.575 --> 00:12:01.475
- Tojo, you have some too.
- Oh, yeah.

00:12:02.525 --> 00:12:03.525
You should have some too, bro.

00:12:13.105 --> 00:12:14.165
Thank you.

00:12:14.695 --> 00:12:16.465
- Let's eat.
- Please, enjoy.

00:12:22.105 --> 00:12:23.835
Wow, this is delicious!

00:12:24.455 --> 00:12:25.455
I'm glad.

00:12:25.895 --> 00:12:27.605
Ayato, you really love pudding, don't you?

00:12:27.925 --> 00:12:29.565
Yeah, it's my favorite.

00:12:31.675 --> 00:12:32.675
Bro.

00:12:33.575 --> 00:12:34.575
Actually,

00:12:34.805 --> 00:12:36.465
the reason I first started to notice Ayato...

00:12:36.615 --> 00:12:37.935
was because of pudding, too.

00:12:39.995 --> 00:12:40.995
Pudding?

00:12:42.245 --> 00:12:44.355
It was the last pudding at the school store.

00:12:44.355 --> 00:12:46.335
Ayato and I both reached for it at the same time.

00:12:46.485 --> 00:12:48.275
So we ended up sharing it.

00:12:51.775 --> 00:12:52.775
Mmm.

00:13:01.015 --> 00:13:02.015
It was so good.

00:13:07.715 --> 00:13:08.715
Yeah.

00:13:09.245 --> 00:13:10.245
It was amazing.

00:13:12.245 --> 00:13:14.075
You can have the last bite.

00:13:15.035 --> 00:13:16.035
Tojo...

00:13:21.395 --> 00:13:22.395
Here.

00:13:28.325 --> 00:13:29.325
It's so good.

00:13:32.175 --> 00:13:35.125
Tojo... Stop, this is so embarrassing.

00:13:35.535 --> 00:13:36.735
Brings back memories.

00:13:40.045 --> 00:13:41.775
Aww.

00:13:42.475 --> 00:13:44.105
Oh, so it all started with a pudding...

00:13:44.585 --> 00:13:46.065
Huh? A prince and princess?

00:13:46.275 --> 00:13:47.405
Oh, pudding, ahh.

00:13:47.995 --> 00:13:49.625
- Ahh!
- What's wrong, dude?

00:13:52.505 --> 00:13:54.545
Delicious.

00:13:54.895 --> 00:13:56.265
Ooh, let me try that one too.

00:13:56.315 --> 00:13:57.795
Hey! Don't just grab it, man!

00:13:58.855 --> 00:14:01.465
- That's mine, give it back!
- If you don't mind, you can have mine.

00:14:01.465 --> 00:14:02.725
- Oh, I'll help myself then.
- Hey, man.

00:14:02.725 --> 00:14:04.485
- You've got some nerve.
- It's all right.

00:14:04.775 --> 00:14:06.785
Well, well, Ayato and Tojo.

00:14:06.785 --> 00:14:09.845
Your meet-cute is just
as innocent as I imagined.

00:14:10.095 --> 00:14:12.075
A love story that started with a pudding.

00:14:12.405 --> 00:14:13.525
Makes my heart skip a beat~

00:14:14.325 --> 00:14:15.325
My heart's fluttering.

00:14:17.505 --> 00:14:24.455
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL 2024"

00:14:34.325 --> 00:14:35.325
Tomoya.

00:14:36.385 --> 00:14:38.785
Hey, can you please cover my shift?

00:14:39.515 --> 00:14:41.695
I totally forgot my mom is coming to Tokyo.

00:14:42.235 --> 00:14:43.385
Oh?

00:14:44.065 --> 00:14:47.245
Such a good son.

00:14:48.095 --> 00:14:49.765
Yeah, sure.

00:14:50.745 --> 00:14:51.745
Awesome!

00:14:52.615 --> 00:14:55.055
You're the best!

00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:04.945
Hey, cut it out.

00:15:05.345 --> 00:15:06.565
Everyone's looking at us.

00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:14.695
Is another couple getting together over here?

00:15:26.645 --> 00:15:27.645
Please.

00:15:28.045 --> 00:15:29.345
Join our club.

00:15:30.005 --> 00:15:31.105
Our cheer squad...

00:15:31.125 --> 00:15:32.845
is in danger of being disbanded.

00:15:35.085 --> 00:15:36.845
I don't mind.

00:15:37.285 --> 00:15:38.285
You will?

00:15:38.475 --> 00:15:39.475
Really?

00:15:40.315 --> 00:15:41.315
However...

00:15:41.405 --> 00:15:43.105
I have one condition.

00:15:43.755 --> 00:15:44.755
A condition?

00:15:44.805 --> 00:15:48.515
Name it. If it's something I can do, I'll do it.

00:15:49.625 --> 00:15:53.475
Will you be the captain of my love life's cheer squad?

00:15:53.665 --> 00:15:54.505
Huh?

00:15:56.345 --> 00:15:59.515
I've always had a crush on you.

00:16:01.045 --> 00:16:03.285
I like you too.

00:16:03.745 --> 00:16:06.415
A romance flag has been raised.

00:16:12.885 --> 00:16:14.765
No, seriously, what kind of college students are these?

00:16:15.595 --> 00:16:16.595
But still...

00:16:16.785 --> 00:16:18.745
another couple's getting together here.

00:16:21.215 --> 00:16:22.355
Anyway...

00:16:23.405 --> 00:16:26.485
in this BL world, helping someone out...

00:16:26.565 --> 00:16:28.995
is very likely to trigger a major flag.

00:16:33.715 --> 00:16:35.205
VS

00:16:35.245 --> 00:16:36.495
The Favor

00:16:36.595 --> 00:16:37.635
Arc

00:16:38.615 --> 00:16:40.065
In any case...

00:16:41.325 --> 00:16:43.755
I absolutely cannot agree to help anyone out.

00:16:44.855 --> 00:16:46.465
A mob character has to act like one.

00:16:47.025 --> 00:16:48.605
I need to erase my own presence.

00:16:52.205 --> 00:16:54.325
Oh, excuse me, you over there.

00:16:54.395 --> 00:16:56.015
- Don't panic.
- Excuse me.

00:16:56.765 --> 00:16:59.605
I've already minimized my presence to the absolute limit.

00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:02.915
There's no way anyone would talk to me.

00:17:02.965 --> 00:17:03.965
Hey, you.

00:17:04.125 --> 00:17:05.125
Excuse me.

00:17:05.295 --> 00:17:06.475
Don't panic.

00:17:07.045 --> 00:17:09.345
Why would anyone be talking to me?

00:17:10.115 --> 00:17:11.125
Yes, you.

00:17:11.215 --> 00:17:12.095
Huh?

00:17:12.345 --> 00:17:14.725
Could you help me with something?

00:17:15.945 --> 00:17:17.175
Help?

00:17:33.065 --> 00:17:33.865
Just a moment.

00:17:33.925 --> 00:17:35.755
The main character and his lover
will be looking at each other here.

00:17:35.755 --> 00:17:38.065
We need you to walk around in the background naturally.

00:17:38.835 --> 00:17:39.835
Okay.

00:17:40.945 --> 00:17:42.865
The only reason they talked to me...

00:17:43.255 --> 00:17:45.975
was because they needed an extra.

00:17:46.735 --> 00:17:48.185
That's a mob character for you.

00:17:49.705 --> 00:17:50.705
See?

00:17:50.975 --> 00:17:53.825
That main character over there,
with his sparkling aura...

00:17:54.545 --> 00:17:56.895
could you ever give off this kind of aura that,
no matter how you look at it...

00:17:56.895 --> 00:17:59.645
is clearly a mob character?

00:18:00.345 --> 00:18:01.545
No way.

00:18:02.975 --> 00:18:06.765
As long as I'm just an extra, there's no way I'll trigger a flag.

00:18:09.065 --> 00:18:10.065
Good morning.

00:18:11.485 --> 00:18:13.485
The actor playing the love interest is here.

00:18:14.815 --> 00:18:15.855
It's a pleasure to be working with you.

00:18:16.025 --> 00:18:17.515
- All right, if you could come over here.
- Okay.

00:18:18.775 --> 00:18:19.775
Oh.

00:18:20.325 --> 00:18:22.255
This is the world of BL, after all.

00:18:22.725 --> 00:18:25.075
Of course, the love interest is also a man.

00:18:27.505 --> 00:18:28.975
Even from far away...

00:18:28.975 --> 00:18:31.235
he's radiating that sparkling aura.

00:18:31.345 --> 00:18:33.695
That's the main character's lover for you.

00:18:34.145 --> 00:18:35.145
All right.

00:18:35.535 --> 00:18:37.485
Let's get a look at your face.

00:18:42.345 --> 00:18:43.345
Huh?

00:18:50.915 --> 00:18:51.915
Huh?

00:18:53.245 --> 00:18:54.245
Three years.

00:18:54.725 --> 00:18:55.725
In three years...

00:18:55.925 --> 00:18:57.595
when I turn 20, I'll say it again.

00:18:58.385 --> 00:18:59.385
That I love you.

00:18:59.975 --> 00:19:01.175
I...

00:19:01.515 --> 00:19:03.575
have no intention of giving up on you.

00:19:04.675 --> 00:19:05.675
So...

00:19:06.125 --> 00:19:07.125
um...

00:19:08.995 --> 00:19:10.355
That's all I wanted to tell you.

00:19:11.685 --> 00:19:13.505
What is going on?

00:19:14.225 --> 00:19:16.045
What is this guy doing here?

00:19:24.775 --> 00:19:25.775
Um...

00:19:27.285 --> 00:19:30.295
It looks like a flag has been raised
in another unexpected place.

00:19:30.805 --> 00:19:33.455
All right, next up is the long-awaited final episode.

00:19:33.485 --> 00:19:35.175
Wait, no, not "long-awaited."

00:19:35.205 --> 00:19:37.445
It's the "Wait, stay away from me" final episode.

00:19:37.445 --> 00:19:39.745
Anyway, make sure you watch until the end.

00:19:43.505 --> 00:19:45.005
"A Man Who Defies the World of BL 2024"

00:21:14.865 --> 00:21:16.315
(Next Episode)
Huh? No way.

00:21:16.385 --> 00:21:17.585
Is that me?

00:21:18.165 --> 00:21:22.395
I look exactly like a main character in this BL world.

00:21:22.405 --> 00:21:24.935
He seems to be drawn to you.

00:21:25.275 --> 00:21:26.275
Huh?

00:21:26.425 --> 00:21:28.455
You don't have to worry about me.

00:21:28.825 --> 00:21:31.035
It still hurts even now.

00:21:31.295 --> 00:21:34.295
To avoid the biggest flag of my life...

00:21:34.625 --> 00:21:35.825
My feelings...

00:21:36.585 --> 00:21:37.895
can't you accept them?

00:21:38.335 --> 00:21:39.535
I really...

00:21:40.535 --> 00:21:41.945
can't forget you.

00:21:42.675 --> 00:21:43.975
What am I going to do?
