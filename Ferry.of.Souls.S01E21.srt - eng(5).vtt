00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.800
A single man and woman alone in a room

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.930
is highly improper.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.160
Master Liu has invited you,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.420
which is a great honor.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.100
Hurry up and go.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.160
I refuse to go.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.960
How high the bright moon rises,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.200
Cold shadows fall across the curtains.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.720
A woman sighs alone,

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.680
Who will share her joy?

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.160
If we're appreciating the moon,

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.120
why sit so close?

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.000
Miss,

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.579
have you caught a cold?

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.520
Autumn hasn't arrived yet,

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.980
but your hands are so cold.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.560
Actually,

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.040
I have a deficiency illness.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.960
All the doctors said

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.800
I wouldn't live past 30.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.320
Fortunately, I met

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.680
a master hermit who saved me.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.680
However...

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.100
Though my life was spared,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.090
my constitution

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.520
is not as strong as before.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.640
To face such hardship at such a young age

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.640
means good fortune will follow.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.080
Heaven has been kind to me,

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.440
otherwise how could I have the pleasure of your company

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.700
for this little drink?

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.920
I'm sorry.

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:27.680
It's fine.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.720
Perhaps I've been ill for too long,

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.840
these hands are weak

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.520
and can't even hold a cup steady.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.240
I'll go fix my clothes.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.860
Please make yourself comfortable, Master Liu.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.200
Murder!

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.200
This is too horrific.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.000
This manor is filled with treasures.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.130
The killer must have

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.560
come for the treasures.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.360
Innkeeper...

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.659
These two died in a strange position.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.040
They appear to be kneeling in repentance.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.970
And the murderer

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.260
used a single sword

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.280
to pierce both their hearts.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.000
Must have had a deep grudge against them.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Wanted them dead.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.690
And took pleasure in it.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.800
Has the killer escaped already?

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.840
Not necessarily.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.060
The manor is heavily guarded.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.760
I'm afraid

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.840
the killer is still among us.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.080
Everyone,

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.400
there has been a murder at the manor.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.920
As the manor owner, I bear responsibility.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.400
But please rest assured,

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.760
I've arranged for guards to patrol day and night

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.780
to ensure everyone's safety.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.680
The treasure appraisal event

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.210
will proceed as scheduled.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.800
I agree with Miss Shangguan's opinion.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.200
Wu Hu and Chen Jiang

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.400
were both honored guests I invited.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.960
Yet they lost their lives here.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.420
I will definitely find the killer

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.330
and bring justice for them.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.580
How does Manor Owner Liu plan to catch the murderer?

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:55.000
It's simple.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.000
The guests who were drinking in their rooms

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.130
can all provide alibis for each other.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.200
I'm sorry,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.460
when the murder happened,

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.080
I was strolling in the garden

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.660
with no one to verify my whereabouts.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.650
Miss Shangguan,

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.410
at the time of the incident,

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.360
where were you?

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.090
I was feeling unwell

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.840
and resting alone in my room.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.200
Oh.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:28.640
Oh.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.360
So in that case,

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.250
no one can vouch for you.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.860
I can vouch for her.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.000
Sir.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.280
If I remember correctly,

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.000
at that time,

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.120
you and I

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.720
were supposed to be drinking in the garden.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.720
That's right.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.640
I accidentally

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:54.820
spilled wine on your clothes.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.530
While waiting for you to change your clothes,

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.080
I suddenly heard cries for help from the front hall.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.480
So I went to investigate.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:02.840
On my way,

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.850
I happened to meet Lady Shangguan.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:11.250
Ouch!

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.660
Innkeeper.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.410
What are you doing here?

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.040
I heard shouting over there.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.580
Can't I go check it out?

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.600
But to get from the guest rooms to the lobby,

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.400
you don't need to pass through here.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.200
Mind your own business.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.130
Get out of my way.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.440
Haha!

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:34.840
Sir,

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.380
it's not that I don't believe you.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.420
From the garden and guest room to the front hall,

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.960
these are two different directions.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.760
How could you two possibly meet?

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:46.680
Madam Liu,

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.260
you don't need to deliberately point fingers at me.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.300
Compared to me,

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.760
there's someone here

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.610
who is more suspicious.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.060
There's someone else?

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.330
Miss Shangguan.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.080
Stop slandering me.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:13.760
Lady Liu.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.770
Do you know that from the garden

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.920
I can see directly into your bedroom window?

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.760
So what?

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.240
After you changed your clothes,

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.480
did you brush your hair?

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.360
What of it?

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.800
When I was drinking with you,

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.600
I noticed you use your left hand.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.039
But after you returned to your room,

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:35.900
the person brushing their hair used the right hand.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.000
It takes just one bow

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:42.559
to switch places with someone else.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.120
And I've noticed your personal maid

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.240
has a figure quite similar to yours.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.720
So whether it was really you in that room

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.850
remains uncertain.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.160
Your whereabouts at the time of the incident

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.290
are still a mystery.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.100
Therefore,

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.060
you are also a suspect.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.360
Nonsense.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.720
I have no grudge against either of them.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.000
Why would I plot to kill them?

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.280
No grudge?

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.060
I'm not so sure about that.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:16.800
Sir.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.770
For any accusation,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.360
you need evidence.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.620
There is evidence.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:24.450
Lady Liu.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.600
The fragrance you use

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.640
is made from Southern Qianpu grass,

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.160
which is extremely rare and valuable.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.440
We only need to smell your maid

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.400
to see if she wears the same scent,

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.530
and then we'll know.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.730
Whether it was you who changed clothes

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:39.480
or her.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.120
That won't be necessary.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.690
I killed the person.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.000
This manor is full of treasures.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.540
You must have come for the treasures.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.080
That's right.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:30.120
Wait.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:32.490
Li Wubai,

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.780
are you going to sacrifice yourself for Liu Yiyi again?

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.570
What do you mean by that?

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:43.780
Master Liu.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.210
I have a story from three years ago.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.880
Would you like to hear it?

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.000
Actually...

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:52.240
Li Wubai back then

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.840
didn't intentionally cause Liu Yiyi's death.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.720
Liu Yiyi was born with a deficiency.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:32.400
Yiyi.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.000
What's wrong?

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:40.880
Yiyi.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:46.970
Yiyi.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.090
Yiyi.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:59.160
Yiyi.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:00.840
You're awake.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.690
I'll get you some water.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:10.520
Senior.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.680
Sit down and talk with me for a while.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.410
Take it easy.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.080
How are you feeling?

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:22.800
Any better?

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:24.770
Much better.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.160
I've probably been practicing too much lately.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:28.960
It's nothing.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.000
Yiyi.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:32.880
About your practice,

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.560
you mustn't rush it.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.340
Otherwise, it could backfire on you.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.960
Let me take care of you, will you?

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.200
Senior.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.280
Aren't we good

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.260
just the way we are now?

00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.240
No.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:01.520
Yiyi.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.080
I want to see you in a wedding dress,

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.520
riding in a bridal sedan chair,

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.880
marrying me with full honors,

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.810
so we can spend our lives together.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.200
Why won't you accept me?

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.820
I've consulted many famous doctors,

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.280
and they all say I won't live past 30.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:19.560
It's me.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.320
It's my problem.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.890
That's impossible.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:26.980
It can't be true, Yiyi.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.800
There are so many doctors in the world.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.600
Someone will cure your illness.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:35.960
It's useless.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:37.890
This might be

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:39.920
my fate.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.000
I will find a way.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.690
Li Wubai wanted to steal the Silver Flower

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.280
to cure Liu Yiyi's illness.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.280
He pretended to agree

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.320
to conspire with Wu Hu and Chen Jiang

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.920
just to buy himself some time.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.640
Stealing this treasure.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:03.170
Li Wubai,

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.760
why aren't you with your beautiful lady today?

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.900
Instead you're free to drink with us.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.760
Brother Li, take it easy.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.800
You dare to get drunk and wild with me?

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:16.160
Chen.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.120
I can team up with you,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.600
but from the money we get for the Silver Flower,

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.800
I want half.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:26.560
Chen,

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.640
good brother,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.330
sit down and let's talk.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.020
Let's talk.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.000
Hahaha!

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:38.700
Brother Li,

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:39.840
have a drink.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:40.240
Ha ha.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.160
Junior,

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.040
we're running low on medicine.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.500
You should rest well here.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:55.480
I'll go to the West Market

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.680
to get more medicine.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.140
Senior.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.760
When this escort mission is over,

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.040
I will...
