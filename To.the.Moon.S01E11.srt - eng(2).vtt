- Eun Sang!

We hit the jackpot!

00:00:17.155 --> 00:00:20.085
- Our crypto's up! It's really up!
- Look at this.

00:00:20.085 --> 00:00:21.085
Really?

00:00:21.825 --> 00:00:24.455
I'm quitting my job.
I'm just done with this place.

00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:25.625
What?

00:00:27.625 --> 00:00:29.035
Hold on, what?

00:00:32.935 --> 00:00:33.935
Dear deities,

00:00:34.305 --> 00:00:36.575
why is my heart pounding right now?

00:00:37.035 --> 00:00:41.005
Is it because my crypto dream
is finally coming true?

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:46.185
Or is it because he's about to quit
and give up a jackpot of a bonus,

00:00:46.185 --> 00:00:48.445
all for some unrealistic
dream of his?

00:00:51.655 --> 00:00:53.025
Dear deities,

00:00:53.555 --> 00:00:55.695
please, just give me an answer.

(Kang Eun Sang Store,
For When You Need It Most)

00:00:59.365 --> 00:01:01.065
(Episode 11: Out Into the World)

00:01:11.575 --> 00:01:13.645
Why the long face?
I thought your crypto went up.

00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:15.005
That's the thing.

00:01:15.345 --> 00:01:18.115
When I think about the crypto,
my heart...

00:01:18.885 --> 00:01:20.085
begins pounding,

00:01:20.585 --> 00:01:24.815
but when I think of you, Dr. Ham,
I get all twisted up inside.

00:01:25.015 --> 00:01:27.585
Come on, just accept
the situation, okay?

00:01:27.885 --> 00:01:30.055
Once they accept my resignation,
it's done.

00:01:30.355 --> 00:01:33.665
- But they haven't accepted it yet.
- Look, where did we just come from?

00:01:35.225 --> 00:01:36.995
We just went to get that, didn't we?

00:01:37.135 --> 00:01:39.935
To actually find the guitar I sold
when I quit music...

00:01:40.165 --> 00:01:42.275
at a secondhand market...

00:01:42.405 --> 00:01:45.035
as I restart music is totally...

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:47.245
- A total coincidence.
- It's fate.

00:01:47.545 --> 00:01:49.745
I finally feel like
I'm on solid ground.

00:01:50.015 --> 00:01:53.985
It feels like I've finally shaken
the rock out of my shoe.

00:01:54.845 --> 00:01:57.215
Now all I have to do is quit.

00:01:57.215 --> 00:01:59.255
They haven't accepted it yet.

00:01:59.355 --> 00:02:00.685
Look, about that...

00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:03.355
What?

00:02:03.895 --> 00:02:05.495
- What's wrong with this thing?
- What's going on?

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:06.865
Why did we stop?

00:02:07.665 --> 00:02:08.665
It won't even start.

00:02:10.935 --> 00:02:11.935
What?

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:14.405
I guess this is what
needs fixing now.

00:02:20.905 --> 00:02:22.775
Okay, and what time did you say
you'd be here?

00:02:24.545 --> 00:02:27.015
Okay. Yes, take your time.
No rush at all.

00:02:28.085 --> 00:02:29.515
Okay, thank you.

00:02:30.015 --> 00:02:31.085
Okay.

00:02:36.255 --> 00:02:37.755
What'd they say?
Are they on their way?

00:02:38.455 --> 00:02:40.665
They said it'd be about an hour.

00:02:40.865 --> 00:02:41.995
I see.

00:02:43.365 --> 00:02:45.735
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

00:02:46.405 --> 00:02:48.905
I was feeling a little cooped up,
so it's nice to get some fresh air.

00:02:49.035 --> 00:02:51.035
Cooped up? Why?
Is it your gastritis again?

00:02:51.335 --> 00:02:53.345
- What about your medicine?
- Once before bed.

00:02:53.675 --> 00:02:56.075
But I doze off and keep forgetting,
so it's not getting any better.

00:02:56.145 --> 00:02:58.245
- Why do you keep forgetting...
- Hey, you know what?

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:01.045
I think something's wrong
with this guitar.

00:03:01.485 --> 00:03:03.255
It sounds a little weird. Listen.

00:03:06.885 --> 00:03:11.525
Oh my.
A divine sign you shouldn't quit?

00:03:13.565 --> 00:03:16.095
"Oh my," or is that just the sound
of an out-of-tune guitar?

00:03:19.005 --> 00:03:20.005
Give it here.

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:39.455
This view...

00:03:39.955 --> 00:03:41.725
is suddenly making me want to sing.

00:03:50.835 --> 00:03:55.205
On the long roads I have traveled

00:03:56.635 --> 00:03:59.745
My weary heart

00:04:00.945 --> 00:04:03.445
Searches for a place of rest

00:04:04.715 --> 00:04:08.785
Letting out a sigh

00:04:09.855 --> 00:04:12.455
On a lonely, foreign night

00:04:15.085 --> 00:04:19.695
Like a tender greeting

00:04:20.565 --> 00:04:25.265
Is the one I still long for

00:04:28.835 --> 00:04:31.875
- With you, all right
- With you, all right

00:04:32.545 --> 00:04:36.375
- You make me feel all right
- You make me feel all right

00:04:36.615 --> 00:04:40.745
- Oh, my darling, my love
- Oh, my darling, my love

00:04:43.685 --> 00:04:48.485
- Even if the world stops
- Even if the world stops

00:04:48.685 --> 00:04:50.055
- Always
- Always

00:04:50.395 --> 00:04:55.125
- I won't let go of your hand now
- I won't let go of your hand now

00:04:57.535 --> 00:04:58.935
Be with you

00:05:19.285 --> 00:05:20.485
What's with the look?

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:24.095
- Was it that bad?
- It was amazing.

00:05:24.755 --> 00:05:25.765
It's so frustrating.

00:05:27.265 --> 00:05:29.965
I don't get it. If it was amazing,
why is that frustrating?

00:05:32.635 --> 00:05:34.965
At a time like this,
I wish you weren't so amazing.

00:05:35.405 --> 00:05:36.475
If you weren't so amazing,

00:05:37.305 --> 00:05:39.035
I wouldn't be this worried.

00:05:39.705 --> 00:05:41.105
Why? Are you worried about me?

00:05:42.345 --> 00:05:43.745
How could I not be?

00:05:45.215 --> 00:05:46.745
Do you really have to go to England?

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:50.015
You don't...

00:05:51.115 --> 00:05:52.115
want me to go?

00:05:53.185 --> 00:05:54.525
Should I give up on music again?

00:05:57.425 --> 00:05:58.925
No, of course you have to.

00:05:59.695 --> 00:06:00.865
So many more people...

00:06:01.265 --> 00:06:02.795
need to hear your music.

00:06:04.335 --> 00:06:07.705
When you get on stage,
sing every track from one to 11.

00:06:07.765 --> 00:06:09.305
And make sure you sing number two.

00:06:10.705 --> 00:06:14.445
But do you really have to go as far
as quitting your job?

00:06:16.975 --> 00:06:17.975
Just think about it.

00:06:24.015 --> 00:06:25.215
You're leaving someone...

00:06:25.615 --> 00:06:26.755
as beautiful as me...

00:06:27.655 --> 00:06:29.055
behind.

00:06:29.355 --> 00:06:30.455
Can you really do that?

00:06:35.425 --> 00:06:37.635
I mean,
of course, I know this act...

00:06:38.235 --> 00:06:39.805
doesn't work on you, but...

00:06:44.205 --> 00:06:45.275
I'm telling you, it is.

00:06:52.115 --> 00:06:53.845
But who said anything
about leaving you behind?

00:06:54.585 --> 00:06:55.585
What?

00:06:58.415 --> 00:06:59.425
Well...

00:07:11.135 --> 00:07:13.405
- Why are you laughing?
- No, it's just...

00:07:14.165 --> 00:07:18.435
The whole vibe just feels like
you're about to propose.

00:07:21.005 --> 00:07:23.775
If that was actually the plan,
then you...

00:07:24.175 --> 00:07:26.285
- just made it awkward.
- Come on. No way.

00:07:26.615 --> 00:07:28.715
There's no ring or flowers.

00:07:29.085 --> 00:07:32.925
If it's going to be a proposal,
you need to have all that, right?

00:07:33.085 --> 00:07:34.155
And getting down on one knee...

00:07:39.565 --> 00:07:42.225
Wait, were you about to get down
on one knee?

00:07:43.535 --> 00:07:46.005
You completely ruined the surprise,

00:07:46.765 --> 00:07:49.065
but I guess I still have to do it.

00:07:56.775 --> 00:07:58.915
- You have flowers too?
- I guess...

00:08:02.245 --> 00:08:03.315
I'd need those too, right?

00:08:14.195 --> 00:08:15.295
Wait, don't tell me...

00:08:16.265 --> 00:08:17.935
you're going to give me a ring too?

00:08:18.165 --> 00:08:20.405
You keep spoiling everything,

00:08:21.805 --> 00:08:23.005
but I guess I have to give you one.

00:08:36.585 --> 00:08:39.185
Are you really going to say it?

00:08:40.385 --> 00:08:41.385
I love you.

00:08:43.095 --> 00:08:44.095
Will you...

00:08:45.255 --> 00:08:46.295
marry me?

00:08:57.675 --> 00:08:58.735
Kim Ji Song.

00:08:58.735 --> 00:09:00.505
- Yes?
- Why are these client codes old?

00:09:00.575 --> 00:09:01.745
They all changed last week.

00:09:02.175 --> 00:09:03.345
What? But...

00:09:04.115 --> 00:09:06.445
Nobody told me anything about that.

00:09:07.285 --> 00:09:10.615
What are you talking about?
I had Mr. Yoon tell you on Friday.

00:09:10.755 --> 00:09:11.755
Right, Mr. Yoon?

00:09:12.725 --> 00:09:13.925
What? Me?

00:09:14.285 --> 00:09:16.795
Mr. Yoon was out all last week...

00:09:16.795 --> 00:09:18.855
What?
So you're saying it's my fault?

00:09:19.365 --> 00:09:21.695
- No. That's not it.
- Give me a break.

00:09:21.925 --> 00:09:24.795
If I ask you to do one thing,
just do it right. Please.

00:09:28.635 --> 00:09:31.035
Are you slacking off,
or is it because you're an O.O?

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:34.275
- Just go.
- Yes.

00:09:34.605 --> 00:09:35.805
I'm sorry.

00:09:41.345 --> 00:09:42.655
Make me a cup of green tea
before you go.

00:09:44.055 --> 00:09:45.055
Okay.

00:09:52.195 --> 00:09:53.695
If he's calling me a slacker "O.O,"

00:09:54.295 --> 00:09:56.795
does that make him a
psycho pervert or something?

00:09:57.965 --> 00:09:59.435
I can't stand him.
Seriously. Darn it.

00:10:18.855 --> 00:10:19.855
(A business owner earns
100,000 dollars after quitting job.)

00:10:20.025 --> 00:10:21.025
What?

00:10:21.555 --> 00:10:22.725
Hee Jung?

00:10:24.325 --> 00:10:25.595
(Q. Why did you start
your own business?)

00:10:25.655 --> 00:10:29.225
I used to be a product researcher
at another company.

00:10:29.365 --> 00:10:33.135
I was an O.O there...
No, I was on a permanent contract.

00:10:33.405 --> 00:10:37.775
So, no one really believed in me,
and I had no mentor to guide me.

00:10:39.005 --> 00:10:40.905
That's when it hit me.

00:10:41.245 --> 00:10:44.715
"I'm the one who has to build
my own future."

00:10:45.375 --> 00:10:48.415
And with that, I decided to jump
into the world of startups.

00:10:48.685 --> 00:10:50.755
(Any words for aspiring
entrepreneurs?)

00:10:50.815 --> 00:10:52.155
Don't torture yourself.

00:10:52.315 --> 00:10:53.585
What?

00:10:55.985 --> 00:10:59.125
Instead of agonizing
over unanswerable questions,

00:10:59.595 --> 00:11:01.895
just get started now,
whatever it is.

00:11:02.195 --> 00:11:04.965
Life is just too short
to waste away...

00:11:05.135 --> 00:11:07.805
in a place where you're not valued.

00:11:08.965 --> 00:11:09.975
Right.

00:11:12.075 --> 00:11:13.375
Life is short.

00:11:15.905 --> 00:11:17.115
And I really hate my job.

00:11:20.485 --> 00:11:21.785
Congratulations.

00:11:22.185 --> 00:11:26.655
Da Hee, congratulations.
Are you now Ms. Jung?

00:11:27.655 --> 00:11:31.695
I'm just up for a promotion review.
It's not a done deal yet.

00:11:31.895 --> 00:11:34.065
Come on, who else would get it
but you, Da Hee?

00:11:34.265 --> 00:11:37.295
Exactly. You did well with Cocomishu
and the snack subscription.

00:11:37.295 --> 00:11:38.395
- That's enough of that.
- Why?

00:11:38.465 --> 00:11:40.735
Hey, Da Hee,
you should treat us today.

00:11:42.165 --> 00:11:45.205
Okay. In that case,
lunch is on me today.

00:11:45.575 --> 00:11:47.545
- Let's all go...
- Da Hae.

00:11:48.305 --> 00:11:49.305
You're here?

00:11:49.775 --> 00:11:51.245
Da Hae, I'm hungry. Come on.

00:11:51.675 --> 00:11:54.745
- Gosh, hurry up.
- Aren't you going to eat with us?

00:11:55.315 --> 00:11:56.885
Never mind.
Let's just go eat like this.

00:11:57.785 --> 00:11:59.255
- Let's just go.
- Should we?

00:11:59.315 --> 00:12:01.055
- Yes.
- Let's get going.

00:12:07.695 --> 00:12:10.265
What, do they think I'm
some kind of saint?

00:12:10.665 --> 00:12:12.595
Did they expect me to just join them
for lunch and congratulate her?

00:12:13.435 --> 00:12:17.375
That snack subscription service
was my idea, you know?

00:12:17.505 --> 00:12:19.605
Come on, they said it was
because Cocomishu did well.

00:12:19.605 --> 00:12:21.005
It had nothing to do with your idea.

00:12:21.545 --> 00:12:24.015
- Whose side are you on?
- I'm just saying, don't be mad.

00:12:24.445 --> 00:12:27.015
Is work worth getting so upset over?

00:12:27.085 --> 00:12:28.745
The crypto charts are going nuts,

00:12:28.745 --> 00:12:31.385
and you just got
a marriage proposal.

00:12:31.455 --> 00:12:34.285
You can quit this job
anytime you want...

00:12:34.355 --> 00:12:37.355
I haven't given him an answer yet.

00:12:38.125 --> 00:12:41.265
- What?
- It was all so sudden,

00:12:41.825 --> 00:12:44.435
- so I asked him for some time.
- I see.

00:12:44.495 --> 00:12:47.535
Right,
and don't trust that crypto chart.

00:12:47.605 --> 00:12:49.105
You never know when it'll tank.

00:12:49.105 --> 00:12:50.105
What?

00:12:50.175 --> 00:12:51.775
Why?
Do you think it will drop again?

00:12:52.235 --> 00:12:54.145
Not necessarily,

00:12:54.275 --> 00:12:56.515
but there's talk
of crypto regulation,

00:12:56.775 --> 00:12:59.045
and rumors of alternative
crypto currencies being delisted.

00:12:59.045 --> 00:13:01.285
Before it starts affecting us,

00:13:01.345 --> 00:13:03.855
I think it might be a good idea
to just exit our position.

00:13:03.915 --> 00:13:05.755
What, you want to pull out
when it's doing so well?

00:13:08.555 --> 00:13:10.755
You're right.
We should play it safe.

00:13:11.895 --> 00:13:13.025
Right.

00:13:13.095 --> 00:13:17.195
Knowing the right time to pull out
is the most crucial part of it.

00:13:17.295 --> 00:13:21.305
Otherwise, when you're complacent,
you'll get blindsided.

00:13:22.465 --> 00:13:23.475
Bam...

00:13:24.305 --> 00:13:27.145
And I was the one who just got hit.

00:13:28.805 --> 00:13:30.015
What is this?

00:13:30.475 --> 00:13:31.745
What is this?

00:13:32.375 --> 00:13:35.215
A disciplinary hearing?

00:13:35.945 --> 00:13:38.455
Nothing has been officially
decided yet.

00:13:38.515 --> 00:13:41.085
It's a heads-up that
there might be a hearing...

00:13:41.085 --> 00:13:42.085
because of the Kang Eun Sang Store.

00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:44.225
What about the Kang Eun Sang Store?

00:13:44.595 --> 00:13:47.025
Why would I be disciplined
over that?

00:13:47.125 --> 00:13:50.695
Company policy says for-profit activity
is grounds for discipline.

00:13:50.765 --> 00:13:53.565
The company's just been looking
the other way until now.

00:13:56.675 --> 00:13:58.435
As a loyal customer
of the Kang Eun Sang Store,

00:13:58.435 --> 00:14:00.205
I find this situation unfortunate.

00:14:00.275 --> 00:14:03.345
Please prepare yourself,
just in case.

00:14:03.445 --> 00:14:05.615
If it just hadn't been
for that post.

00:14:05.675 --> 00:14:08.015
A post? What post?

00:14:08.085 --> 00:14:09.815
Not Hoppang Bite again.

00:14:09.885 --> 00:14:11.385
What do you guys think
about the Kang Eun Sang Store?

00:14:11.385 --> 00:14:13.785
Running a business here isn't right.

00:14:13.855 --> 00:14:17.125
I got food poisoning from her drink.
I thought I was going to die.

00:14:17.195 --> 00:14:19.295
I think she resells expired stuff.

00:14:19.295 --> 00:14:21.625
The quality's crap,
and her prices are crazy.

00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:23.865
- We should make this known, right?
- Darn it, seriously...

00:14:23.865 --> 00:14:26.095
Come on.
Like I'd ever sell anything expired.

00:14:26.165 --> 00:14:28.605
What are we going to do?
I just overheard...

00:14:28.605 --> 00:14:29.605
that if you got disciplined,

00:14:29.605 --> 00:14:31.875
you could be suspended
for a month without pay.

00:14:33.175 --> 00:14:34.745
Get Grandma Na Moon Hee.

00:14:35.205 --> 00:14:36.545
She has to give this post
a piece of her mind.

00:14:36.615 --> 00:14:37.615
A hundred times over.

00:14:37.675 --> 00:14:40.685
But a month should be okay, right?
Besides, your crypto is way up.

00:14:40.745 --> 00:14:43.515
Hey, you can't compare the two.

00:14:43.855 --> 00:14:47.525
You absolutely need a steady income,
like a salary.

00:14:48.555 --> 00:14:49.555
Then what are we supposed to do?

00:14:49.625 --> 00:14:52.655
Ms. Eun Sang! There you are.

00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:55.295
Hey, can I get two cup noodles
and two pain relief patches, please?

00:14:55.365 --> 00:14:56.765
We're closed today.

00:14:56.865 --> 00:14:59.035
I get it.
I won't ask to put it on my tab.

00:15:00.135 --> 00:15:03.205
- Wait, you're serious?
- Yes, there's a bit of a situation.

00:15:03.635 --> 00:15:06.575
Ms. Eun Sang, can I get stockings?
In tan.

00:15:06.645 --> 00:15:07.745
About that...

00:15:08.405 --> 00:15:10.745
You wouldn't have a hangover drink?

00:15:10.745 --> 00:15:12.215
I drank way too much yesterday.

00:15:12.275 --> 00:15:13.485
Is the Kang Eun Sang Store
closed today?

00:15:13.485 --> 00:15:15.985
Excuse me, everyone.

00:15:16.715 --> 00:15:18.885
Kang Eun Sang Store is
temporarily closed.

00:15:19.155 --> 00:15:20.985
No, we can't do business.

00:15:21.085 --> 00:15:23.025
But your products
are all right here.

00:15:23.025 --> 00:15:24.125
I'm sorry.

00:15:24.125 --> 00:15:25.625
I'll pay you ten dollars right now.

00:15:25.625 --> 00:15:27.195
- I'll pay you cash this time.
- I'm sorry.

00:15:27.365 --> 00:15:29.025
- Please...
- I can't believe this...

00:15:29.525 --> 00:15:30.865
Da Hae, talk to her at least.

00:15:31.295 --> 00:15:33.065
- I have to go to a store now.
- Let's go.

00:15:34.065 --> 00:15:35.905
Wait, this is it.

00:15:37.105 --> 00:15:39.135
- What?
- What?

00:15:39.205 --> 00:15:41.545
Look, many people need
the Kang Eun Sang Store.

00:15:41.545 --> 00:15:43.175
All of these people.

00:15:44.475 --> 00:15:45.575
And?

00:15:45.975 --> 00:15:49.345
One time, we had a huge meeting,
and we were all out of coffee.

00:15:49.415 --> 00:15:51.615
I'm telling you,
if it wasn't for Kang Eun Sang Store,

00:15:51.915 --> 00:15:53.855
we would've had to hold that meeting
without a single cup of coffee.

00:15:53.955 --> 00:15:57.855
They make us work overtime,
but we still have to be here early.

00:15:58.295 --> 00:16:02.095
And on top of that, they don't even
stock shampoo in the staff lounge.

00:16:02.795 --> 00:16:05.165
It's thanks to the shampoo
and razors Ms. Eun Sang sells...

00:16:05.265 --> 00:16:08.165
that I can even show up to work
without looking like a total slob.

00:16:08.235 --> 00:16:09.305
If the Kang Eun Sang Store is gone,

00:16:09.305 --> 00:16:11.705
the nearest store is
three intersections away.

00:16:12.235 --> 00:16:14.275
In that case, they should at least
give us a longer lunch break.

00:16:15.645 --> 00:16:16.975
By the way,

00:16:17.315 --> 00:16:18.815
this is completely anonymous, right?

00:16:19.215 --> 00:16:23.215
Yes. Don't you worry.
We're just going to compile it...

00:16:23.285 --> 00:16:24.915
and use it for the petition.

00:16:24.985 --> 00:16:26.855
Just to show how indispensable...

00:16:26.855 --> 00:16:29.525
the Kang Eun Sang Store
has been to the staff.

00:16:29.625 --> 00:16:31.925
Oh, well, if that's all,
then I don't mind.

00:16:35.265 --> 00:16:37.395
- Keep up the fight.
- What?

00:16:37.465 --> 00:16:40.105
Everyone will be in a bind
if the Kang Eun Sang Store is gone.

00:16:41.065 --> 00:16:42.065
Hang in there.

00:16:44.535 --> 00:16:45.905
Thank you.

00:16:46.605 --> 00:16:48.205
Here, Da Hae.

00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:51.075
I didn't think anyone
would agree to help.

00:16:53.645 --> 00:16:55.585
This still isn't quite enough,
though.

00:16:55.985 --> 00:16:58.155
This won't amount to much
on the petition.

00:17:00.085 --> 00:17:01.525
Do we really have to do this?

00:17:02.425 --> 00:17:05.255
Come on, Mr. Ko.

00:17:05.325 --> 00:17:06.525
You'll be the most inconvenienced...

00:17:06.525 --> 00:17:08.395
if the Kang Eun Sang Store
disappears.

00:17:08.465 --> 00:17:10.465
You're hungover almost every day.

00:17:10.465 --> 00:17:11.865
Where will you get
your hangover drinks...

00:17:11.935 --> 00:17:13.635
and headache pills?

00:17:13.635 --> 00:17:15.165
No, I'm talking about Ms. Eun Sang.

00:17:15.205 --> 00:17:17.205
Does she really need to do this?

00:17:17.335 --> 00:17:18.975
- What?
- I heard...

00:17:18.975 --> 00:17:20.575
she made a fortune in crypto.

00:17:23.675 --> 00:17:25.275
How much are we talking?

00:17:26.245 --> 00:17:30.215
Why are you so curious about that?
I thought you valued honest work.

00:17:32.285 --> 00:17:33.925
I can't keep grinding away forever.

00:17:34.125 --> 00:17:37.125
Before they put me out to pasture,
I need to make a killing too...

00:17:39.255 --> 00:17:41.025
Are you going to tell me or not?

00:17:41.465 --> 00:17:42.495
You won't tell me, will you?

00:17:42.695 --> 00:17:43.695
Fine, I'm not doing the interview.

00:17:43.765 --> 00:17:45.335
Mr. Ko, wait!

00:17:45.335 --> 00:17:47.305
I've already set up the camera.

00:17:47.365 --> 00:17:49.165
Come on, you said you'd do it!

00:17:49.805 --> 00:17:52.705
Darn it! He's really gone. Shoot.

00:17:52.975 --> 00:17:54.445
It's no use.

00:17:55.645 --> 00:17:57.575
What do you mean?

00:17:58.175 --> 00:17:59.775
The disciplinary hearing
for Kang Eun Sang Store.

00:18:00.745 --> 00:18:02.515
It's going to happen no matter what.

00:18:02.885 --> 00:18:04.115
I was the one who reported her.

00:18:04.185 --> 00:18:06.155
I thought it was Hoppang Bite...

00:18:06.155 --> 00:18:07.525
That's me.

00:18:08.185 --> 00:18:09.185
What?

00:18:13.225 --> 00:18:14.895
I'm Hoppang Bite.

00:18:16.025 --> 00:18:18.665
But I figured just posting
on the company board...

00:18:18.765 --> 00:18:20.865
wouldn't be enough for a hearing.

00:18:21.335 --> 00:18:25.075
So I made a formal report to HR,
and I'm on my way back now.

00:18:25.475 --> 00:18:28.505
So Ms. Eun Sang will probably
be hearing from them soon.

00:18:28.905 --> 00:18:30.175
Wait. No, hold on a second.

00:18:30.745 --> 00:18:32.375
What are you talking...

00:18:33.415 --> 00:18:34.985
You're who?

00:18:35.585 --> 00:18:36.755
Hoppang Bite.

00:18:37.315 --> 00:18:38.315
What...

00:18:38.815 --> 00:18:39.955
So...

00:18:40.485 --> 00:18:43.995
I just don't understand
what you're saying.

00:18:43.995 --> 00:18:45.825
I really can't wrap
my head around it.

00:18:46.625 --> 00:18:47.995
Will this make it clearer?

00:18:50.295 --> 00:18:51.965
(My Posts:
Hoppang Bite, Kang Eun Sang Store)

00:18:52.035 --> 00:18:53.535
(I heard someone at our company
made a million dollars in crypto.)

00:18:54.235 --> 00:18:55.665
So it really was you...

00:18:57.705 --> 00:18:58.835
But why?

00:19:00.045 --> 00:19:02.775
And why are you telling me
all this now?

00:19:02.845 --> 00:19:05.145
This isn't the right place to talk.

00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:07.245
How about we get some coffee...

00:19:07.315 --> 00:19:08.645
Are you kidding me right now?

00:19:10.585 --> 00:19:12.385
Why did you report
the Kang Eun Sang Store?

00:19:13.055 --> 00:19:15.355
If the hearing affects Eun Sang...

00:19:15.355 --> 00:19:16.385
Will she get fired?

00:19:17.325 --> 00:19:20.095
Probably not.
It'd be nice if she did, though.

00:19:20.425 --> 00:19:21.765
What did you say?

00:19:21.825 --> 00:19:23.795
Will you keep seeing Dr. Ham?

00:19:24.565 --> 00:19:26.805
I'd like it if you two broke up.

00:19:27.135 --> 00:19:30.235
If you'd done that sooner,
I wouldn't have gone this far.

00:19:30.305 --> 00:19:32.005
Da Hee, don't tell me...

00:19:32.605 --> 00:19:35.205
you're doing all this
because you like Dr. Ham?

00:19:36.945 --> 00:19:40.715
I guess that's as far
as your imagination goes.

00:19:42.285 --> 00:19:44.385
- How boring.
- Jung Da Hee.

00:19:44.455 --> 00:19:46.455
You must be busy preparing
for the hearing.

00:19:47.625 --> 00:19:49.185
I'll be on my way.

00:19:58.895 --> 00:20:00.565
Gosh. What was that?
That's so creepy.

00:20:02.105 --> 00:20:03.435
Is this some kind of
hidden camera prank?

00:20:04.675 --> 00:20:05.675

00:20:12.175 --> 00:20:13.175
(Dear Ms. Kang, this concerns
your commercial activities...)

00:20:13.175 --> 00:20:14.615
(and is notice of
a disciplinary hearing.)

00:20:14.715 --> 00:20:17.985
But why in the world would
Hoppang Bite target me?

00:20:18.115 --> 00:20:20.585
Trolls don't exactly pick and choose
their targets, you know.

00:20:20.685 --> 00:20:22.825
I have a feeling they did pick
their target this time.

00:20:23.655 --> 00:20:24.655
What?

00:20:26.125 --> 00:20:28.495
About Hoppang Bite...

00:20:28.495 --> 00:20:29.495
What?

00:20:35.665 --> 00:20:36.675
Nevermind.

00:20:37.305 --> 00:20:39.135
It leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

00:20:39.135 --> 00:20:40.405
What is it?

00:20:43.375 --> 00:20:44.375
Eun Sang,

00:20:44.675 --> 00:20:46.575
we're not going to let this
beat us, okay?

00:20:46.645 --> 00:20:49.285
That hearing? Let's go in there
and completely crush it.

00:20:50.255 --> 00:20:51.285
That's right.

00:20:51.285 --> 00:20:52.415
So on that note...

00:20:53.955 --> 00:20:55.455
Let's start with a practice run.

00:20:56.855 --> 00:20:57.895
What?

00:21:02.365 --> 00:21:03.395
Ms. Kang Eun Sang,

00:21:04.065 --> 00:21:06.335
why, exactly, were you selling
products at work?

00:21:07.105 --> 00:21:08.335
That's because...

00:21:08.865 --> 00:21:11.135
You were blinded by your greed!

00:21:11.205 --> 00:21:12.605
What? Hey.

00:21:12.605 --> 00:21:14.975
Are you laughing?
Do you find this amusing?

00:21:15.345 --> 00:21:17.345
You're in front of a
disciplinary committee!

00:21:17.415 --> 00:21:20.245
"You?" You two are something else.

00:21:20.245 --> 00:21:21.345
Hey.

00:21:21.345 --> 00:21:22.785
Stop slouching...

00:21:22.785 --> 00:21:25.015
and address
the committee with respect.

00:21:27.185 --> 00:21:28.355
Honorable members of the committee,

00:21:28.685 --> 00:21:30.195
could you please tone it down?

00:21:30.525 --> 00:21:34.065
Eun Sang,
the real hearing will be much worse.

00:21:34.125 --> 00:21:36.225
That's why we have to
practice properly.

00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:39.335
Exactly. "One month of unpaid leave"
is just code.

00:21:39.395 --> 00:21:41.335
If things go south
and you actually get fired...

00:21:44.235 --> 00:21:45.435
I apologize.

00:21:48.445 --> 00:21:49.445
I...

00:21:50.475 --> 00:21:52.615
in this hallowed company,

00:21:53.385 --> 00:21:57.015
committed the profane commercial act
known as Kang Eun Sang Store.

00:21:57.615 --> 00:21:58.915
I am truly sorry.

00:22:00.125 --> 00:22:03.395
But to me, this company is
more than just a job.

00:22:05.425 --> 00:22:06.765
It was my life,

00:22:07.595 --> 00:22:08.895
my dream,

00:22:09.925 --> 00:22:12.495
and it was my last link
to the outside world.

00:22:14.605 --> 00:22:17.875
I tarnished that
noble company culture...

00:22:18.235 --> 00:22:21.775
and sullied it with my own greed.

00:22:21.975 --> 00:22:23.205
Never again...

00:22:24.915 --> 00:22:29.185
Never will I act so foolishly again.

00:22:31.485 --> 00:22:32.485
I beg you,

00:22:34.085 --> 00:22:36.025
please forgive me just this once.

00:22:42.465 --> 00:22:43.795
Best Actress?

00:22:44.135 --> 00:22:47.005
I think she's already
won one of those.

00:22:52.005 --> 00:22:53.005
Was it convincing?

00:22:56.975 --> 00:23:00.145
Why don't you play
the boyfriend card?

00:23:00.715 --> 00:23:01.845
The boyfriend card?

00:23:02.115 --> 00:23:03.855
You know, Dr. Ham.

00:23:04.355 --> 00:23:07.085
He did resign,
but it hasn't been processed yet.

00:23:07.185 --> 00:23:08.585
He should still have
some pull, right?

00:23:09.425 --> 00:23:11.455
Want me to ask him
to stop the action...

00:23:11.455 --> 00:23:12.855
against the Kang Eun Sang Store?

00:23:13.525 --> 00:23:14.825
Forget it.

00:23:15.195 --> 00:23:17.135
He's got enough on his plate
as it is.

00:23:17.495 --> 00:23:18.765
Why? What's bothering him?

00:23:19.295 --> 00:23:20.505
You.

00:23:20.865 --> 00:23:23.035
You still haven't answered
his proposal.

00:23:23.935 --> 00:23:26.235
It's not that I haven't
answered him.

00:23:26.305 --> 00:23:29.545
I just have a lot on
my mind about it.

00:23:30.575 --> 00:23:32.015
Like what? What's on your mind?

00:23:33.145 --> 00:23:34.145
Eun Sang.

00:23:34.585 --> 00:23:39.355
I was imagining what it'd be like
if I went to England with Dr. Ham.

00:23:40.115 --> 00:23:42.855
- But...
- But what? You don't like it?

00:23:44.055 --> 00:23:47.365
It was amazing!
No, you have to imagine it too.

00:23:47.365 --> 00:23:50.435
We're talking England. Cambridge.

00:23:50.635 --> 00:23:53.665
I'd start my days in a brick house
overlooking the River Cam.

00:23:54.105 --> 00:23:57.535
I'd relax with some tea
and fish and chips.

00:23:57.605 --> 00:23:59.775
Then in the afternoon,
I'd go to London...

00:23:59.775 --> 00:24:01.905
for a stroll near Buckingham Palace.

00:24:02.005 --> 00:24:06.045
And maybe check out
those handsome Royal Guards.

00:24:06.615 --> 00:24:09.815
In the evening, I'd watch the sunset
over the River Thames...

00:24:09.885 --> 00:24:12.685
and have a nice glass of wine...

00:24:13.985 --> 00:24:15.855
I'd probably get drunk. Right.

00:24:16.895 --> 00:24:19.125
I should behave myself
in a foreign country, right?

00:24:20.155 --> 00:24:22.865
If you've figured it all out,
why wait?

00:24:22.865 --> 00:24:24.095
You sound so happy about it.

00:24:24.735 --> 00:24:27.105
I know, right? Why am I hesitating?

00:24:32.205 --> 00:24:35.205
Anyway, don't you worry.

00:24:35.505 --> 00:24:37.875
Even if you get suspended
or lose pay,

00:24:37.875 --> 00:24:38.945
what's the big deal?

00:24:39.215 --> 00:24:41.685
- What?
- You've got us.

00:24:41.945 --> 00:24:43.755
You think we can't take care of you?

00:24:43.755 --> 00:24:45.185
What do you think we make money for?

00:24:45.355 --> 00:24:48.925
That's enough.
Ma'am, what's that called again?

00:24:48.985 --> 00:24:52.125
We'll get you the VIP package
at a retirement community.

00:24:52.125 --> 00:24:53.225
Just trust us.

00:24:54.595 --> 00:24:56.825
Are you laughing? Answer me!

00:24:57.265 --> 00:24:58.735
- Answer me.
- Hey.

00:24:58.795 --> 00:25:00.305
- Answer!
- This is as far as I go.

00:25:00.365 --> 00:25:01.965
- Answer!
- Go on. Get going.

00:25:12.845 --> 00:25:15.015
- What are you doing?
- Observing.

00:25:15.245 --> 00:25:16.245
Observing what?

00:25:16.845 --> 00:25:20.325
I saw on TV that
daily life offers startup ideas.

00:25:20.825 --> 00:25:23.895
If I look closely at everyday faces,
I might see something new.

00:25:26.495 --> 00:25:28.595
You're right.

00:25:29.125 --> 00:25:30.765
I do see something new.

00:25:31.435 --> 00:25:32.435
You've got a sunspot.

00:25:32.495 --> 00:25:35.165
What? Where?

00:25:35.235 --> 00:25:37.835
A startup? Please.
Now that you have a little money,

00:25:37.905 --> 00:25:39.175
you're getting all sorts of
wild ideas.

00:25:40.475 --> 00:25:42.645
- They are not wild ideas.
- Yes, they are.

00:25:43.175 --> 00:25:46.145
Not everyone can start a business,
you know?

00:25:46.315 --> 00:25:48.615
If you're just doing this
without doing any real research,

00:25:48.815 --> 00:25:51.415
and you just want to be treated
like a CEO, then...

00:25:52.455 --> 00:25:56.885
Profit structure, capital, loans,
market analysis, and site selection.

00:25:57.495 --> 00:26:00.255
I've researched all of that.
I've also started business training.

00:26:00.795 --> 00:26:02.195
I just need to land on an idea.

00:26:02.625 --> 00:26:03.735
What?

00:26:03.895 --> 00:26:08.135
I don't want to be treated
like a CEO, but like a human being.

00:26:08.505 --> 00:26:10.065
But I can't get that at the company.

00:26:11.635 --> 00:26:14.575
My future lies outside this company.

00:26:44.505 --> 00:26:46.335
(Marron Confectionery)

00:26:46.535 --> 00:26:48.575
(Written Statement)

00:26:51.815 --> 00:26:53.475
Good morning, Da Hae.

00:26:54.715 --> 00:26:56.685
Are you all prepared for
the disciplinary hearing today?

00:26:58.285 --> 00:27:01.125
Look. Don't talk to me. It's creepy.

00:27:05.695 --> 00:27:10.095
I thought you'd post on the forum
that I'm Hoppang Bite.

00:27:10.465 --> 00:27:11.535
But you didn't.

00:27:13.495 --> 00:27:14.505
Why not?

00:27:15.135 --> 00:27:16.865
Did you think
no one would believe you?

00:27:20.235 --> 00:27:23.075
- You should've at least tried.
- I told you not to talk to me.

00:27:24.175 --> 00:27:26.375
Aren't you curious why I did it?

00:27:28.645 --> 00:27:29.985
I could tell you why.

00:27:33.055 --> 00:27:34.325
Want to meet up after the hearing?

00:27:34.955 --> 00:27:37.655
- We could grab a coffee.
- Not later.

00:27:39.055 --> 00:27:40.055
Let's talk now.

00:27:40.925 --> 00:27:41.925
Follow me.

00:27:45.635 --> 00:27:47.035
You crazy psycho!

00:27:48.805 --> 00:27:49.865
I swear...

00:27:50.735 --> 00:27:53.675
When you only gave me an Americano
and threw away my letter,

00:27:53.745 --> 00:27:57.575
and the times you subtly wronged me,
I told myself it wasn't malicious.

00:27:58.215 --> 00:27:59.915
But no more benefit of the doubt.

00:28:00.015 --> 00:28:03.285
From now on, I'm going to assume
your actions are malicious,

00:28:03.755 --> 00:28:04.955
so you'd better watch your back.

00:28:05.415 --> 00:28:07.585
If you mess with me one more time,
you'll regret it.

00:28:07.655 --> 00:28:10.755
And if you mess with my people,
you'll regret that too.

00:28:11.155 --> 00:28:13.965
If something fishy happens
at Eun Sang's hearing today,

00:28:14.295 --> 00:28:15.525
you'll regret that too.

00:28:15.925 --> 00:28:18.295
I'll punch you
in the face next time,

00:28:18.295 --> 00:28:19.995
so you'd better be ready. Got it?

00:28:24.275 --> 00:28:25.905
And one more thing.

00:28:26.405 --> 00:28:27.905
You're Jung Da Hee,

00:28:28.375 --> 00:28:29.675
and I'm Jung Da Hae.

00:28:31.045 --> 00:28:32.045
We're not the same.

00:28:32.545 --> 00:28:36.145
- What?
- Why would I call you Hoppang Bite?

00:28:36.385 --> 00:28:40.655
Why would I waste my precious time
gossiping about your pathetic life?

00:28:42.925 --> 00:28:44.255
You think I'd stoop to your level?

00:29:00.805 --> 00:29:02.945
Eun Sang,
you've got this. Don't be nervous.

00:29:03.005 --> 00:29:04.015
Okay?

00:29:04.915 --> 00:29:06.315
You're shaking more than I am,
you know.

00:29:06.375 --> 00:29:10.515
We've got your back no matter what,
so don't worry about it. Okay?

00:29:10.585 --> 00:29:13.515
Okay. Maybe you should wipe
your mouth first.

00:29:13.755 --> 00:29:16.355
What am I going to do with you guys?

00:29:16.355 --> 00:29:18.125
You're with me
right to the very end.

00:29:29.865 --> 00:29:32.035
- I'm heading in.
- Okay.

00:29:32.305 --> 00:29:33.305
- You've got this!
- You've got this!

00:29:34.075 --> 00:29:36.075
- You can do it!
- Go, Kang Eun Sang!

00:29:36.145 --> 00:29:37.145
Don't be nervous.

00:29:37.815 --> 00:29:38.815
You've got this!

00:29:48.285 --> 00:29:49.285
This is killing me.

00:29:57.595 --> 00:29:58.595
Ms. Kang Eun Sang.

00:29:59.595 --> 00:30:02.665
Please explain why you decided
to sell items on company property.

00:30:05.135 --> 00:30:07.805
You know,
getting a single office supply...

00:30:07.805 --> 00:30:09.875
involves a lot of red tape.

00:30:10.045 --> 00:30:11.915
The equipment we're provided
is often broken,

00:30:12.175 --> 00:30:14.645
and when you're in a pinch,
there are no other options.

00:30:14.985 --> 00:30:17.185
So I personally started keeping...

00:30:17.815 --> 00:30:20.885
a small stash of supplies...

00:30:20.885 --> 00:30:22.155
Ms. Kang Eun Sang.

00:30:22.185 --> 00:30:23.185
This hearing...

00:30:23.555 --> 00:30:25.925
is not the place for you
to complain about company benefits.

00:30:26.055 --> 00:30:28.795
I hear you also sold expired items.

00:30:28.925 --> 00:30:31.865
- No. I've never done that.
- And how can we believe that?

00:30:31.965 --> 00:30:34.605
I have records,
and I've kept photos of everything.

00:30:34.665 --> 00:30:36.965
Please send the records and photos
at a later time.

00:30:37.065 --> 00:30:40.005
- Sounds like quite an operation.
- In any case,

00:30:40.475 --> 00:30:41.975
all those items you sold
to your coworkers,

00:30:42.345 --> 00:30:43.705
you charged them for it, correct?

00:30:46.175 --> 00:30:49.515
There were so many of them,
and such a wide variety of items,

00:30:50.385 --> 00:30:51.585
that giving them all away
for free was...

00:30:51.655 --> 00:30:54.555
Yes. So you sold them
for money, yes or no?

00:31:00.195 --> 00:31:02.265
Yes. I accepted money for them.

00:31:03.525 --> 00:31:04.565
- Da Hae.
- What?

00:31:04.635 --> 00:31:05.635
Can you hear anything?

00:31:06.535 --> 00:31:08.035
No, I can't hear a single thing.

00:31:08.635 --> 00:31:10.335
I hope she's holding her own
in there.

00:31:10.705 --> 00:31:12.675
You're showing your true colors now.

00:31:12.675 --> 00:31:15.645
You did it for money, didn't you?

00:31:16.245 --> 00:31:17.715
Do you love money that much?

00:31:17.715 --> 00:31:19.375
How could you do that at work,

00:31:19.845 --> 00:31:21.815
selling things
to your own coworkers?

00:31:23.145 --> 00:31:24.155
Unbelievable.

00:31:27.055 --> 00:31:28.285
Colleagues...

00:31:31.055 --> 00:31:32.655
Excuse me, but...

00:31:33.155 --> 00:31:37.395
what you all call "coworkers,"
what does that word even mean?

00:31:37.535 --> 00:31:38.565
What?

00:31:38.765 --> 00:31:40.265
Are you saying
when money's involved,

00:31:40.265 --> 00:31:43.035
colleagues don't mean a thing
to you?

00:31:43.135 --> 00:31:44.205
Yes.

00:31:45.575 --> 00:31:47.235
I don't know what...

00:31:47.645 --> 00:31:49.475
this company's definition
of a colleague is.

00:31:51.115 --> 00:31:52.975
The coworkers I know...

00:31:54.645 --> 00:31:56.645
are people with no one to lean on,

00:31:56.645 --> 00:31:58.685
who are trying to survive
on their own.

00:32:00.155 --> 00:32:03.125
They're the ones who needed my help.

00:32:03.685 --> 00:32:05.825
The 14th Open Recruitment hires...

00:32:06.125 --> 00:32:08.195
went out to eat together again,
without us.

00:32:08.295 --> 00:32:11.665
They may seem like trivial things,
but when they pile up,

00:32:11.735 --> 00:32:14.335
the incidents can really make...

00:32:14.405 --> 00:32:15.665
- a person feel small.
- Eun Sang.

00:32:17.405 --> 00:32:20.675
I was the only one who didn't know
the all-hands meeting was moved.

00:32:20.775 --> 00:32:25.175
That kind of thing always happened
to my colleagues with no power.

00:32:26.975 --> 00:32:28.145
Just because we're O.Os,

00:32:28.145 --> 00:32:30.815
isn't it unfair that
we get no holiday gifts?

00:32:30.915 --> 00:32:33.585
I saw and heard it all happening
right in front of me.

00:32:35.625 --> 00:32:39.355
It's the employee lounge,
so I just stepped in for a second,

00:32:39.495 --> 00:32:40.895
but they told me to get out.

00:32:41.765 --> 00:32:42.895
(Heat pack)

00:32:44.595 --> 00:32:46.765
How could I possibly
turn a blind eye?

00:32:49.105 --> 00:32:50.105
And so,

00:32:50.935 --> 00:32:54.475
something I started just to help out
in a small way...

00:32:54.975 --> 00:32:56.775
grew into the Kang Eun Sang Store.

00:32:57.205 --> 00:33:00.045
Yes, right. So?
What happened after it grew?

00:33:00.115 --> 00:33:01.945
You turned the office
into a marketplace.

00:33:07.585 --> 00:33:09.155
Yes, you're right.

00:33:09.625 --> 00:33:11.925
My intentions aside,

00:33:11.925 --> 00:33:14.365
it's true I started a business here,

00:33:14.425 --> 00:33:17.635
and as a result,
money did end up changing hands.

00:33:20.595 --> 00:33:21.665
Therefore,

00:33:30.705 --> 00:33:32.045
(Letter of Resignation)

00:33:32.145 --> 00:33:34.245
I am submitting my resignation.

00:33:35.045 --> 00:33:36.215
Your resignation?

00:33:36.215 --> 00:33:38.415
Are you saying you're quitting?

00:33:38.485 --> 00:33:40.615
I have to take responsibility
for my actions.

00:33:40.755 --> 00:33:43.855
What? No, you should be begging
for another chance,

00:33:44.255 --> 00:33:45.825
and even that might not be enough,
but instead you do this.

00:33:45.895 --> 00:33:47.525
Yes. Please be lenient.

00:33:48.495 --> 00:33:52.735
I know it's shameless to resign,
but I ask this of you.

00:33:54.035 --> 00:33:55.865
Please look after...

00:33:56.805 --> 00:33:58.435
my coworkers.

00:34:01.145 --> 00:34:04.845
Please ensure my colleagues
are not discriminated against...

00:34:05.075 --> 00:34:07.075
and that they can receive
fair treatment.

00:34:08.615 --> 00:34:12.885
And that our company and environment
don't hinder their growth.

00:34:14.325 --> 00:34:15.555
So that...

00:34:15.885 --> 00:34:18.225
the future they dream of
in this company...

00:34:18.925 --> 00:34:21.365
doesn't have to feel so bleak.

00:34:23.365 --> 00:34:26.335
From now on,
I ask that all of you here...

00:34:26.395 --> 00:34:29.805
to please pay closer attention
to them.

00:34:32.405 --> 00:34:33.805
Sincerely,

00:34:34.945 --> 00:34:36.705
I ask this of you.

00:34:48.255 --> 00:34:49.955
Do we really need to continue
with this?

00:34:52.355 --> 00:34:53.855
Am I the only one who's embarrassed
right now?

00:35:00.565 --> 00:35:02.535
Da Hae, it's over.

00:35:02.905 --> 00:35:04.435
Hey, come here!

00:35:08.045 --> 00:35:09.175
Eun Sang.

00:35:11.115 --> 00:35:13.215
- How did it go?
- Did everything go okay?

00:35:15.445 --> 00:35:17.115
I have something to tell you guys.

00:35:20.985 --> 00:35:22.185
Thank you.

00:35:22.385 --> 00:35:24.195
(Your Beer, Custom Craft Beer)

00:35:24.695 --> 00:35:26.295
What do you mean you're quitting?

00:35:26.555 --> 00:35:28.425
What are you talking about?

00:35:28.625 --> 00:35:30.695
Did something go wrong
at the hearing?

00:35:30.995 --> 00:35:33.035
Are those people still giving you
a hard time?

00:35:33.235 --> 00:35:35.635
Of course they are.
It's all the company's fault.

00:35:35.735 --> 00:35:38.205
Anyway, from A to Z,
it's all the company's fault.

00:35:38.275 --> 00:35:39.935
Stop bad-mouthing the company.

00:35:40.375 --> 00:35:43.545
Still, for me,
there are things I'm grateful for.

00:35:44.715 --> 00:35:46.075
It's how I got to meet you all.

00:35:49.045 --> 00:35:50.245
Back then...

00:35:51.285 --> 00:35:54.485
I know I pretended
you were all a pain,

00:35:55.425 --> 00:35:57.085
but that's not how I really felt.

00:36:11.775 --> 00:36:13.475
Come on, hurry up!

00:36:13.535 --> 00:36:16.245
The late-night fee will kick in
for taxis! Come on!

00:36:16.545 --> 00:36:17.545
- Eun Sang!
- Come on!

00:36:17.615 --> 00:36:18.875
- Come on!
- You've got this!

00:36:18.945 --> 00:36:20.715
The way you would call out to me...

00:36:20.775 --> 00:36:22.645
- Hurry!
- Eun Sang!

00:36:22.645 --> 00:36:23.645
- You've got this!
- Eun Sang!

00:36:23.645 --> 00:36:26.585
I really liked hearing that.

00:36:28.755 --> 00:36:31.995
When life got so hard that I wanted
to throw everything away...

00:36:32.295 --> 00:36:34.095
and just wanted to die,

00:36:34.795 --> 00:36:36.665
hearing you call for me
gave me strength.

00:36:38.735 --> 00:36:42.835
Or maybe I was just
making that my excuse.

00:36:43.705 --> 00:36:45.305
For your sakes,

00:36:45.635 --> 00:36:47.945
I'd tell myself to just hang on
for one more day.

00:36:49.275 --> 00:36:50.675
"Let's live."

00:36:51.115 --> 00:36:52.345
"Let's live."

00:36:56.085 --> 00:37:00.055
Now that I think about it,
raising you was a great excuse.

00:37:01.385 --> 00:37:03.185
Then keep raising us.

00:37:03.925 --> 00:37:06.655
- Keep raising us then.
- But looking at you now,

00:37:07.425 --> 00:37:10.925
you're all so much more grown up
than I thought.

00:37:11.465 --> 00:37:14.465
You don't need
my protection anymore.

00:37:15.165 --> 00:37:16.465
So I think it's time...

00:37:16.535 --> 00:37:20.305
to finally be liberated
from these parenting trenches.

00:37:21.675 --> 00:37:22.975
It's my turn now...

00:37:23.875 --> 00:37:25.615
to get out there.

00:37:26.645 --> 00:37:27.915
Out into the world.

00:37:28.415 --> 00:37:30.815
And keep going, with no limits.

00:37:31.955 --> 00:37:33.215
Eun Sang...

00:37:33.685 --> 00:37:35.425
I mean, but still...

00:37:37.725 --> 00:37:39.255
What's with you?

00:37:39.855 --> 00:37:40.895
I'm trying not to cry.

00:37:41.625 --> 00:37:44.735
She needs to spread her wings,
but she can't if I cry.

00:37:45.595 --> 00:37:46.965
But every time I open my mouth,

00:37:47.535 --> 00:37:49.635
I'm afraid I'll just end up
begging her to stay.

00:37:50.505 --> 00:37:51.875
So that's why.

00:37:55.345 --> 00:37:57.815
Gosh, you're really something else.

00:38:08.855 --> 00:38:11.595
I'm not going to cry. I'm not.

00:38:20.965 --> 00:38:22.265
Don't you cry.

00:38:22.935 --> 00:38:25.275
Don't cry, Eun Sang.

00:38:30.005 --> 00:38:31.745
- This is delicious.
- Just eat up.

00:38:31.945 --> 00:38:34.275
Gosh, you already bought us dinner.

00:38:34.275 --> 00:38:36.245
Should you be buying us drinks too?

00:38:36.445 --> 00:38:38.785
- Thank you, Da Hee.
- Don't mention it.

00:38:38.855 --> 00:38:41.955
Hey, now that I think about it,
shouldn't Da Hae have come with us?

00:38:42.025 --> 00:38:44.925
Come on.
Besides, is Da Hae even in the mood?

00:38:45.325 --> 00:38:47.595
She seemed to have high hopes
for this promotion review.

00:38:48.225 --> 00:38:49.265
She must be really disappointed.

00:38:49.595 --> 00:38:52.095
But Da Hae has been on a roll.

00:38:52.635 --> 00:38:54.365
I think she's even better at her job
than we are.

00:38:54.435 --> 00:38:56.465
Come on, what good does that do?

00:38:56.605 --> 00:38:58.035
In the end,
she is still an off-cycle hire.

00:38:58.035 --> 00:38:59.935
She's still just Jung Da Hae.

00:39:00.475 --> 00:39:02.745
Our Jung Da Hee and that Jung Da Hae
are completely different.

00:39:02.805 --> 00:39:06.245
You're Jung Da Hee,
and I'm Jung Da Hae.

00:39:06.415 --> 00:39:08.015
We're not the same.

00:39:08.285 --> 00:39:10.515
- How are we any different?
- What did you say?

00:39:12.785 --> 00:39:13.815
Pardon?

00:39:14.425 --> 00:39:17.455
Have you all decided what to order?

00:39:17.525 --> 00:39:19.125
- Yes.
- What?

00:39:19.195 --> 00:39:21.195
- I'll go place the order.
- Fried chicken for me.

00:39:21.265 --> 00:39:22.425
I'll have the fruit platter.

00:39:24.365 --> 00:39:25.365
I'd like to place an order.

00:39:25.435 --> 00:39:27.335
- Great work today, everyone.
- See you tomorrow.

00:39:29.065 --> 00:39:30.065
Da Hee?

00:39:33.975 --> 00:39:36.545
Assistant Manager Lee?
What are you doing here?

00:39:37.245 --> 00:39:39.475
I was having a drink
with some people from work.

00:39:39.975 --> 00:39:43.145
I thought that might be you,
and I was right.

00:39:44.115 --> 00:39:45.115
Yes.

00:39:46.115 --> 00:39:47.685
How have you been?

00:39:49.285 --> 00:39:50.785
"How have I been?"

00:39:53.895 --> 00:39:54.895
That's rich.

00:39:55.925 --> 00:39:57.025
(Marron Confectionery,
Jung Da Hee)

00:39:57.565 --> 00:39:59.835
So you left our company
for Marron Confectionery?

00:40:01.435 --> 00:40:02.435
Yes.

00:40:03.705 --> 00:40:05.475
I know quite a few people there.

00:40:06.575 --> 00:40:08.845
I should give them a call.
It's been a while.

00:40:09.875 --> 00:40:11.045
I'll be going.

00:40:16.385 --> 00:40:18.815
Da Hee, you haven't changed a bit.

00:40:19.285 --> 00:40:20.685
Still so cheerful.

00:40:22.555 --> 00:40:23.585
It's disgusting.

00:40:49.585 --> 00:40:50.715
Ji Song?

00:40:54.155 --> 00:40:56.355
What? My popcorn.

00:40:56.455 --> 00:40:57.825
Ji Song, wait.

00:41:01.025 --> 00:41:02.325
Mr. Oh!

00:41:08.465 --> 00:41:11.035
Were you eating all that
by yourself?

00:41:12.135 --> 00:41:13.275
No.

00:41:13.805 --> 00:41:16.345
I was with my friends just now,

00:41:16.505 --> 00:41:19.045
but I wanted to get some fresh air
before heading back.

00:41:22.815 --> 00:41:26.185
Where'd you get the popcorn from?

00:41:28.155 --> 00:41:29.725
Hee Jung gave it to me.

00:41:30.555 --> 00:41:32.695
- Who?
- Hee Jung.

00:41:33.455 --> 00:41:36.465
The employee who was on
the R and D team.

00:41:37.425 --> 00:41:39.065
I heard she opened a pub nearby,

00:41:39.365 --> 00:41:40.765
so that's where I just came from.

00:41:40.835 --> 00:41:43.665
Hee Jung. Yes, I heard about that.

00:41:44.135 --> 00:41:46.305
That she hit it big
with her craft beer.

00:41:47.475 --> 00:41:48.505
So you heard.

00:41:52.145 --> 00:41:53.675
But that success of hers...

00:41:55.245 --> 00:41:57.045
That could have been me, actually.

00:41:58.155 --> 00:41:59.155
What do you mean?

00:41:59.215 --> 00:42:02.885
Customizing beer to your own taste
and all that.

00:42:03.825 --> 00:42:06.825
Actually, that was an idea
I had a while ago.

00:42:08.625 --> 00:42:11.435
And I have a ton of other
great ideas besides that one.

00:42:13.135 --> 00:42:15.905
Right now, people are just
drinking bubble tea,

00:42:16.065 --> 00:42:21.075
but later, something way sweeter
like brown sugar boba will trend.

00:42:21.945 --> 00:42:23.645
Right, and that
"personal color" analysis thing...

00:42:23.745 --> 00:42:27.515
The technique that finds the most
flattering colors for a person.

00:42:27.575 --> 00:42:30.045
I think that'll be a trend too.
And also...

00:42:32.815 --> 00:42:33.815
I'm serious.

00:42:34.515 --> 00:42:35.525
Sorry?

00:42:35.825 --> 00:42:37.585
I have really good instincts.

00:42:38.055 --> 00:42:40.225
Everything I predict
is bound to take off.

00:42:40.525 --> 00:42:43.495
Yes, I know.
I'm sure you're right, Ji Song.

00:42:43.565 --> 00:42:45.795
What would you know about it,
Mr. Oh?

00:42:46.435 --> 00:42:48.605
People I know just think I'm like...

00:42:48.865 --> 00:42:51.235
some green tea bag lying around...

00:42:51.705 --> 00:42:54.335
in the break room.

00:42:54.945 --> 00:42:56.445
A green tea bag?

00:42:57.145 --> 00:42:58.415
Because they're cheap.

00:42:59.775 --> 00:43:01.075
The kind...

00:43:01.215 --> 00:43:04.415
you just buy a bunch of
and stock anywhere.

00:43:04.985 --> 00:43:06.485
The green tea bag.

00:43:07.755 --> 00:43:10.325
That's exactly how I feel at work.

00:43:11.655 --> 00:43:13.455
Taken for granted,

00:43:14.965 --> 00:43:16.825
always there...

00:43:20.195 --> 00:43:21.505
But nothing special?

00:43:30.175 --> 00:43:31.175
Come to think of it,

00:43:31.575 --> 00:43:34.275
you really are like a green tea bag.

00:43:34.275 --> 00:43:35.585
Hey!

00:43:38.955 --> 00:43:40.315
No, I mean, with a tea bag,

00:43:40.715 --> 00:43:43.155
you have to let it steep
for a while...

00:43:43.155 --> 00:43:44.755
to bring out its deep flavor.

00:43:45.755 --> 00:43:46.955
And you, Ji Song,

00:43:47.595 --> 00:43:49.565
if people took the time
to really get to know you,

00:43:50.425 --> 00:43:52.265
they'd see how special you are.

00:43:52.665 --> 00:43:54.835
I guess people just don't
realize that yet.

00:43:58.075 --> 00:43:59.105
Really?

00:44:00.835 --> 00:44:03.305
Is that what you really think?

00:44:09.115 --> 00:44:12.115
So, are you saying that I could...

00:44:12.285 --> 00:44:16.025
really make it big out there?

00:44:16.025 --> 00:44:17.185
Me? Out there?

00:44:17.255 --> 00:44:19.095
Really?

00:44:30.635 --> 00:44:31.635
Yes.

00:44:32.375 --> 00:44:33.375
Really.

00:44:34.535 --> 00:44:35.545
I mean it.

00:44:37.405 --> 00:44:38.475
What's this?

00:44:39.945 --> 00:44:42.015
His eyes are...

00:44:42.385 --> 00:44:44.085
like grapes.

00:44:45.655 --> 00:44:46.655
Sorry?

00:45:03.405 --> 00:45:05.375
(Ham Ji Woo)

00:45:07.035 --> 00:45:08.035
Hello?

00:45:08.445 --> 00:45:09.575
You sound down.

00:45:09.575 --> 00:45:11.175
Is something wrong?

00:45:12.515 --> 00:45:13.545
It's nothing.

00:45:13.645 --> 00:45:16.515
It sounds like something's wrong.
What, is your stomach upset?

00:45:16.585 --> 00:45:18.155
You forgot your medicine again,
didn't you?

00:45:18.885 --> 00:45:20.355
One thing at a time, please.

00:45:21.315 --> 00:45:22.625
Nothing major is wrong.

00:45:22.955 --> 00:45:24.955
My stomach's just, you know, so-so.

00:45:25.395 --> 00:45:26.795
I just keep forgetting
to take my medication.

00:45:29.865 --> 00:45:30.965
And...

00:45:32.035 --> 00:45:34.395
as for the answer
you've been waiting to hear...

00:45:37.805 --> 00:45:39.235
I just need a little more time.

00:45:39.305 --> 00:45:41.375
Actually, I wasn't that curious
about that one.

00:45:42.575 --> 00:45:44.245
So I guess it's not that important
to you?

00:45:44.675 --> 00:45:47.475
I was just trying to play it cool.
Guess it didn't work?

00:45:50.285 --> 00:45:53.215
Since playing it cool didn't work,
can I just ask?

00:45:53.415 --> 00:45:54.655
Why are you dragging this out?

00:45:56.785 --> 00:45:57.785
It's just that...

00:46:02.095 --> 00:46:03.795
But what would I do in England?

00:46:04.095 --> 00:46:07.595
Whatever you want.
I'll support you in whatever you do.

00:46:09.605 --> 00:46:12.835
What if I decide I want to be
an astronaut? What then?

00:46:12.905 --> 00:46:13.905
I'd make it happen.

00:46:16.145 --> 00:46:18.345
If I said I wanted
to be president...

00:46:18.415 --> 00:46:20.915
What's your ballot number?
Which one am I supposed to check?

00:46:21.945 --> 00:46:22.985
Please.

00:46:23.345 --> 00:46:24.645
You're such a good talker.

00:46:25.615 --> 00:46:28.085
You always just try to get by
with sweet talk.

00:46:28.725 --> 00:46:30.225
Is there something you want?

00:46:30.555 --> 00:46:31.995
I mean...

00:46:32.325 --> 00:46:35.425
Anyone can promise you
the moon and the stars.

00:46:35.895 --> 00:46:38.435
- Next stop, Shingye Station.
- What?

00:46:39.335 --> 00:46:41.865
If you really want to score points
with me...

00:46:42.605 --> 00:46:46.435
What a woman really wants
on a dark night like this,

00:46:47.105 --> 00:46:48.805
is when she gets off the bus...

00:46:51.645 --> 00:46:53.915
is for you to be waiting there
at the stop.

00:47:12.365 --> 00:47:13.565
Waiting, and then what?

00:47:14.065 --> 00:47:16.805
- Something like this?
- What are you doing here?

00:47:16.865 --> 00:47:18.775
- To kiss you?
- What?

00:47:18.835 --> 00:47:21.205
I just scored some points.
Five points.

00:47:23.145 --> 00:47:25.175
No, make that ten points.

00:47:26.145 --> 00:47:28.785
Where are you going after all that?
Why are you just leaving?

00:47:28.845 --> 00:47:31.285
I was passing by
and just stopped to see you.

00:47:31.415 --> 00:47:33.515
Text me as soon as you get home.

00:47:33.815 --> 00:47:35.485
And take your medicine.

00:47:39.695 --> 00:47:41.025
That man, I swear.

00:47:41.395 --> 00:47:44.695
As if I wasn't confused enough,
he has to make my heart flutter.

00:47:45.365 --> 00:47:48.135
It seriously makes me want
to quit my job.

00:48:00.745 --> 00:48:03.985
Hey. Isn't waiting two hours
for just one kiss...

00:48:04.045 --> 00:48:05.785
a pretty bad return for your time?

00:48:05.855 --> 00:48:08.785
It's worth it.
It could be our last kiss.

00:48:08.855 --> 00:48:10.455
Why? You nervous?

00:48:11.125 --> 00:48:13.655
- Because she hasn't said yes?
- She will.

00:48:16.825 --> 00:48:18.465
She will. I know she will, but...

00:48:19.195 --> 00:48:22.065
If there's a one-in-a-million chance
it won't work out between us...

00:48:22.135 --> 00:48:25.175
What do you mean, "one chance?"

00:48:25.535 --> 00:48:30.105
There's a chance her family says no,
the chance her best friends say no,

00:48:30.175 --> 00:48:31.675
the chance your families
are enemies,

00:48:31.675 --> 00:48:33.075
the chance you're half-siblings.

00:48:33.145 --> 00:48:35.585
What? Do we look like half-siblings?

00:48:35.645 --> 00:48:38.615
Does that even seem possible?
Do we look alike?

00:48:39.455 --> 00:48:40.515
You're nuts.

00:48:41.285 --> 00:48:43.685
Why would you scare me like that?

00:48:44.155 --> 00:48:47.625
Anyway, out of all those,
the most likely one is...

00:48:48.795 --> 00:48:50.665
that my mom will be against it.

00:48:51.895 --> 00:48:53.665
The reason I'm here today is...

00:48:53.665 --> 00:48:56.065
that I have something
I must tell you.

00:48:56.965 --> 00:48:58.605
Are you listening?

00:48:59.805 --> 00:49:02.145
I'll just assume you are and say it.

00:49:02.275 --> 00:49:04.205
As a musician,

00:49:05.345 --> 00:49:06.575
I want a new beginning.

00:49:06.575 --> 00:49:08.945
Also, I'm going to marry who I love.

00:49:09.585 --> 00:49:11.145
Marriage...

00:49:11.685 --> 00:49:14.885
I'm going to do it.
I know you may be against it, Mom.

00:49:15.155 --> 00:49:16.685
But you know, that possibility...

00:49:17.325 --> 00:49:19.125
That possibility is
a part of me, too.

00:49:20.295 --> 00:49:21.295
Or at least it was.

00:49:21.655 --> 00:49:22.825
It still is.

00:49:23.325 --> 00:49:26.765
I could have given up on music
and lived a miserable life.

00:49:26.835 --> 00:49:28.505
But she brought me back to life.

00:49:28.705 --> 00:49:30.065
She told me to try again.

00:49:30.205 --> 00:49:33.135
To dream again.
How could I let someone like her go?

00:49:34.505 --> 00:49:36.105
I'm not a fool.

00:49:36.505 --> 00:49:39.375
I'm going through with the marriage.

00:49:39.775 --> 00:49:41.375
Mom, that's a number three!

00:49:41.445 --> 00:49:44.245
If you're going to hit me,
use the driver. I'm ready.

00:49:44.815 --> 00:49:45.885
Hit me with the driver.

00:49:47.415 --> 00:49:49.625
(Marron Confectionery)

00:49:49.685 --> 00:49:52.225
What? What do you mean?

00:49:52.425 --> 00:49:55.265
The shared payment plan you proposed
for the snack subscription box.

00:49:56.065 --> 00:49:57.195
It was intriguing.

00:49:58.465 --> 00:49:59.835
It's a shame it didn't get picked.

00:49:59.835 --> 00:50:01.965
I liked your Children's Day plan too.

00:50:03.535 --> 00:50:04.735
Thank you.

00:50:05.035 --> 00:50:07.175
When I checked your references,

00:50:07.435 --> 00:50:09.505
everyone had nothing
but high praise for you.

00:50:10.175 --> 00:50:12.745
Why did you check my references?

00:50:14.415 --> 00:50:15.915
Moving forward,

00:50:15.915 --> 00:50:20.115
our company is planning to train
internal communication experts.

00:50:20.115 --> 00:50:22.225
Are you interested?

00:50:24.225 --> 00:50:26.125
But I'm on the Marketing Team.

00:50:28.295 --> 00:50:30.025
One of marketing's goals is...

00:50:30.295 --> 00:50:34.095
to help people with their work
and lives, right?

00:50:35.905 --> 00:50:38.365
After all, marketing is about
helping and communicating,

00:50:38.535 --> 00:50:41.635
so it's basically the same job,
just more systematic.

00:50:43.275 --> 00:50:44.275
I see.

00:50:45.875 --> 00:50:47.015
But...

00:50:47.575 --> 00:50:50.185
why are you making me this offer?

00:50:51.345 --> 00:50:53.685
I received a recommendation
from a reliable source.

00:50:55.385 --> 00:50:56.485
Ms. Kang Eun Sang.

00:50:58.495 --> 00:50:59.725
Actually, yesterday...

00:51:01.025 --> 00:51:03.725
I attended the disciplinary hearing
for Ms. Kang Eun Sang's case.

00:51:04.525 --> 00:51:06.765
And as I listened to Ms. Eun Sang,

00:51:07.695 --> 00:51:08.705
I felt a bit ashamed.

00:51:09.035 --> 00:51:11.365
The areas our company overlooked,

00:51:11.935 --> 00:51:14.075
the Kang Eun Sang Store was
filling the voids...

00:51:14.075 --> 00:51:15.375
our company failed to address.

00:51:16.675 --> 00:51:17.775
Right.

00:51:18.275 --> 00:51:20.975
The Kang Eun Sang Store had
everything you could possibly need.

00:51:22.515 --> 00:51:23.515
It wasn't just...

00:51:24.015 --> 00:51:25.585
about the merchandise.

00:51:26.915 --> 00:51:28.455
(Kang Eun Sang Store,
For When You Need It Most)

00:51:28.525 --> 00:51:32.995
In this cold and desolate company
where no one has the luxury to care,

00:51:33.625 --> 00:51:35.725
whether it was for money
or some other reason,

00:51:36.765 --> 00:51:39.595
the fact that there was someone
trying to help others,

00:51:40.835 --> 00:51:44.535
that someone was there to empathize
with people who were struggling,

00:51:45.675 --> 00:51:48.335
it felt like something out of
a fantasy novel to me.

00:51:50.275 --> 00:51:52.245
Completely absurd,

Unfortunately, we lost the fantasy
that was Kang Eun Sang,

00:52:00.985 --> 00:52:03.285
but the story has to continue, right?

can keep on dreaming...

without getting their hearts broken.

00:52:14.235 --> 00:52:15.835
And as for that job,

00:52:17.205 --> 00:52:19.875
I would like you to be the one
to do it, Da Hae.

I have something
I need to tell you...

00:54:13.915 --> 00:54:15.925
Wait, what happened to your lip?

00:54:16.855 --> 00:54:18.825
This? Don't worry about it.

00:54:20.225 --> 00:54:22.325
Listen, I have something
to tell you.

00:54:23.095 --> 00:54:25.495
- About our wedding, my mother...
- Can I go first?

00:54:31.205 --> 00:54:35.035
I think I'm a person
who wants a lot out of life.

00:54:36.175 --> 00:54:37.205
And...

00:54:37.475 --> 00:54:40.275
it seems you'd give me everything
I could ever want.

00:54:41.945 --> 00:54:44.715
Well, making you president
might be a bit of a stretch.

00:54:47.015 --> 00:54:50.355
I've imagined what it would be like
to be married to you.

00:54:51.325 --> 00:54:53.895
But in every scenario I imagined,

00:54:54.455 --> 00:54:59.065
my happiness always came
only from you.

00:55:00.595 --> 00:55:02.265
That's a good thing, right?

00:55:03.535 --> 00:55:04.605
But...

00:55:06.035 --> 00:55:07.935
that's not the kind of happiness...

00:55:08.945 --> 00:55:10.075
I want.

00:55:12.315 --> 00:55:14.915
Whether I succeed or fail,

00:55:14.915 --> 00:55:17.115
I want to find my own happiness.

00:55:17.545 --> 00:55:19.415
That's why I started trading crypto
in the first place.

00:55:20.285 --> 00:55:23.155
You're going to end this
on a good note, right?

00:55:26.795 --> 00:55:27.995
The truth is...

00:55:28.495 --> 00:55:31.125
I don't even know what I would do
if I went to England.

00:55:31.995 --> 00:55:34.165
If I just follow you there
as I am now,

00:55:34.635 --> 00:55:38.205
I'm afraid I'll want to rely on you
for everything.

00:55:39.235 --> 00:55:40.875
And I don't want to be like that.

00:55:42.475 --> 00:55:45.305
And I found mine too, you see.

00:55:46.075 --> 00:55:48.745
My own version of your guitar.

00:55:50.745 --> 00:55:51.845
My dream.

00:55:54.015 --> 00:55:57.385
I found what I really want
to do at work,

00:55:58.085 --> 00:55:59.795
what I'm meant to do.

00:56:01.125 --> 00:56:02.525
So...

00:56:06.065 --> 00:56:07.635
what I'm trying to say is,

00:56:09.835 --> 00:56:12.435
- I don't think we should marry.
- Wait.

00:56:15.005 --> 00:56:18.775
Did my mother really go see you
behind my back?

00:56:18.845 --> 00:56:20.375
Did she actually pull your hair?

00:56:21.875 --> 00:56:23.985
- No.
- Or did some...

00:56:24.015 --> 00:56:25.955
beautiful first love I didn't know
I had show up?

00:56:25.955 --> 00:56:27.615
Is someone trying to drive us apart?

00:56:28.485 --> 00:56:30.685
- No.
- If not that, then maybe...

00:56:31.685 --> 00:56:33.855
Don't tell me we're...

00:56:35.765 --> 00:56:37.095
long-lost half-siblings?

00:56:37.495 --> 00:56:38.595
Dr. Ham.

00:56:39.495 --> 00:56:40.695
So that's a no, right?

00:56:43.665 --> 00:56:44.665
Okay, so...

00:56:45.205 --> 00:56:48.575
because you don't want
to rely on me,

00:56:48.805 --> 00:56:50.605
and you want to stand on your own...

00:56:50.605 --> 00:56:52.945
So, after some soul-searching,

00:56:53.015 --> 00:56:55.945
you've decided not to marry me.
Is that it?

00:56:57.845 --> 00:56:58.855
Gosh!

00:57:00.985 --> 00:57:04.585
Gosh, I never in a million years
saw this coming.

00:57:08.965 --> 00:57:10.065
Dr. Ham.

00:57:10.995 --> 00:57:13.135
I know it'll be hard for us now,

00:57:13.635 --> 00:57:15.505
- but this is for the best...
- No.

00:57:20.835 --> 00:57:22.035
I can't accept this.

00:57:23.975 --> 00:57:27.045
Dr. Ham tried to find...

00:57:27.045 --> 00:57:28.675
a clear reason
that would help him accept it.

00:57:28.745 --> 00:57:30.985
Was I just being that gullible?

00:57:31.485 --> 00:57:34.185
Was this why everything
just went sideways on me?

00:57:40.455 --> 00:57:42.965
Some days, he'd reflect on the past.

00:57:43.025 --> 00:57:44.895
That time we had the accident
in Namhae...

00:57:45.165 --> 00:57:47.595
Maybe something happened
to your head back then?

00:57:49.265 --> 00:57:52.305
Other days, he'd even resort to
the most useless act of all,

00:57:52.435 --> 00:57:55.135
trying to take back what he'd said.

00:57:55.275 --> 00:57:57.045
I'm not one
to stop someone coming...

00:57:57.045 --> 00:57:58.875
or hold on to someone who leaves.

00:58:00.215 --> 00:58:01.915
You're holding on way too tight.

00:58:04.245 --> 00:58:06.015
But when that didn't work...

00:58:10.685 --> 00:58:12.295
Why are you rolling up
your sleeves now?

00:58:19.935 --> 00:58:20.965
Why do you think?

00:58:21.635 --> 00:58:22.965
Why else would I be doing this?

00:58:23.465 --> 00:58:24.635
Da Hae.

00:58:41.815 --> 00:58:43.585
- I won't go.
- What?

00:58:43.685 --> 00:58:45.925
I won't go to England.

00:58:46.495 --> 00:58:48.695
I can just treat music as a hobby.

00:58:48.925 --> 00:58:51.265
Then nothing has to change
between us, right?

00:58:51.825 --> 00:58:52.835
Dr. Ham.

00:58:52.895 --> 00:58:55.865
I can't help it if my feelings
are stronger than yours are for me.

00:58:55.965 --> 00:58:57.865
Because I love you more,

00:58:58.365 --> 00:58:59.575
I'll be the one to give it up.

00:58:59.875 --> 00:59:01.535
No, that's not it at all.

00:59:03.245 --> 00:59:04.445
It's just an excuse, isn't it?

00:59:05.345 --> 00:59:08.645
You're upset I'm quitting my job.
That's the real reason, isn't it?

00:59:09.945 --> 00:59:11.145
What did you just say?

00:59:11.915 --> 00:59:15.755
You liked that I had a steady job
and made good money.

00:59:15.825 --> 00:59:17.725
But now that I'm suddenly talking
about doing music,

00:59:18.155 --> 00:59:19.525
you don't see a future in me.

00:59:19.795 --> 00:59:21.325
Isn't that the real problem?

00:59:24.525 --> 00:59:25.795

00:59:39.415 --> 00:59:42.145

doesn't that fix it?

00:59:42.315 --> 00:59:44.515
That's enough.

00:59:44.585 --> 00:59:46.055

in the money!

01:00:15.115 --> 01:00:17.645

01:00:22.985 --> 01:00:24.525
and cherishment...

01:00:25.525 --> 01:00:27.495
made me believe in myself?

This job used to be a place
I just had to endure,

01:00:34.135 --> 01:00:37.905
but now, it feels like a path
I've chosen for myself.

01:00:38.835 --> 01:00:42.375
So what do you expect me to do,
when I want to see how far I can go?

01:00:43.305 --> 01:00:47.675

or America, or even outer space,

01:00:48.845 --> 01:00:50.945

I will be the one to come to you.

01:01:00.725 --> 01:01:02.865
How long will I have to wait?

01:01:02.995 --> 01:01:06.195
A year or two years? Three?

01:01:07.895 --> 01:01:11.435
We'll have to be apart
for a long time.

01:01:11.435 --> 01:01:13.335
So just tell me
how long that will be.

01:01:15.305 --> 01:01:16.445

01:01:27.315 --> 01:01:30.285
- Okay?
- Gosh, I can't believe this.

01:01:34.125 --> 01:01:36.395
We're saying goodbye without knowing
when we'll see each other again,

01:01:37.295 --> 01:01:38.595

01:04:51.155 --> 01:04:54.395
Turns out Da Hee was Hoppang Bite.

01:04:54.695 --> 01:04:57.625
The people after Hoppang Bite,
as soon as they found out...

01:04:58.025 --> 01:05:00.965
- I gave her this as a gift.
- I can't believe they...

01:05:02.195 --> 01:05:04.305
Wait, where is Da Hee now?

01:05:04.705 --> 01:05:07.105
I've been trying to call her,
but I can't get through...

01:05:09.975 --> 01:05:11.145
Yes, I'm not late.

01:05:11.605 --> 01:05:12.605
Mr. Ko isn't here yet, right?

01:05:13.145 --> 01:05:17.045
Where's Da Hee?
I told her to wait, but she left.

01:05:17.115 --> 01:05:18.885
- Have you seen Da Hee?
- What?

01:05:19.215 --> 01:05:21.555
She came up here before me.
She's not here yet? What's all this?

01:05:21.855 --> 01:05:23.125
What happened here?

01:05:23.525 --> 01:05:25.385
Apparently, Da Hee was Hoppang Bite.

01:05:25.685 --> 01:05:27.195
- What?
- Yes.

01:05:45.405 --> 01:05:46.415
Da Hee!

01:05:50.785 --> 01:05:52.785
- Da Hae, you're here?
- What are you...

01:05:53.055 --> 01:05:54.715
doing over there?

01:05:55.155 --> 01:05:56.785
How did you know I was here?

01:05:57.955 --> 01:05:59.825
Did your imagination get
a little better all of a sudden?

01:06:00.195 --> 01:06:01.225
Jung Da Hee!

01:06:01.555 --> 01:06:02.555
Perfect timing.

01:06:03.365 --> 01:06:04.365
Come over here.

01:06:05.465 --> 01:06:08.065
How about we finally
get that coffee?

01:06:21.515 --> 01:06:24.545
(To the Moon)

01:06:43.805 --> 01:06:45.305
(Special thanks to Baek Ji Won
for her guest appearance)

01:06:45.435 --> 01:06:47.305
- Are you taking time off?
- China.

01:06:47.305 --> 01:06:48.535
Seeing your foreign boyfriend again?

01:06:48.605 --> 01:06:50.505
Mr. Oh, why are you suddenly
meddling in my affairs?

01:06:51.075 --> 01:06:52.405
- Ji Song.
- Wei Lin?

01:06:52.405 --> 01:06:55.775
I've compiled everything
for the handover into a file.

01:06:55.975 --> 01:06:57.115
I want to rest now.

01:06:58.285 --> 01:07:00.415
I'm planning my exit now.

01:07:00.615 --> 01:07:03.285
I miss Dr. Ham so much.

01:07:04.425 --> 01:07:07.495
We, as a society,
have agreed to call that a breakup.

01:07:07.695 --> 01:07:10.095
I came to perform in Korea
with good intentions.

01:07:10.265 --> 01:07:11.295
Dr. Ham...

01:07:14.765 --> 01:07:16.805
