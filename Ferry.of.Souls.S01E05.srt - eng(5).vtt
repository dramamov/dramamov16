00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.259
What are you doing?

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:53.140
Don't move.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:57.479
Boss,

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.680
this is the couple I told you about.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.800
Their cooking skills are exceptional,

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.330
definitely better than anyone in our troupe.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.360
Perfect appearance, aroma, and taste.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.960
Well then,

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.240
stay and help us for a couple of days.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.690
Thank you, boss.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.800
There's a side room in the back yard.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.240
You two can stay there,

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.300
so you'll be available whenever needed.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.900
We'll definitely be at your service.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.200
Brother-in-law,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.920
drink up!

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.880
Ha ha ha!

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.800
Well, I must say,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.260
Jiulang's performance today

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.160
is more flavorful than usual.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.440
Look at that!

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.260
As expected of Master Mei,

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.580
his singing skills have improved again.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.200
What's wrong?

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.530
This Mei Jiulang

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.420
seems different from what we saw before.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.520
Excellent!

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.079
Bravo!

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.320
Good!

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.640
Reward him!

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.840
Give him a generous reward!

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.320
Today's performance,

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.120
though performed by Master Mei,

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.720
has more charm than usual.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.800
Don't you all agree?

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.640
Indeed.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.850
This is Mei Jiulang's room.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.040
It's so tidy.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.659
Does he have OCD or something?

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.400
Today,

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.800
didn't Mei Jiulang ask Su Huasheng to buy rouge?

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.080
He got scolded for it too.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.840
Is this it?

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.240
Should be.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.120
Mei Jiulang brought it back and used it.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.160
What are you doing?

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.000
This is for women.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.400
Try it.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.530
See how it feels.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.250
That'll cost you extra.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.640
You actually look quite cute like this.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.090
But when you speak, you sound like a demon.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.640
What are you thinking about?

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.570
Nothing.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.570
It smells terrible.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:17.800
Like lard.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.880
Apart from his voice issues,

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.570
a famous actor like Mei Jiulang

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.400
would be extremely particular about his makeup products.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.930
He wouldn't casually use inferior products.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.640
Unless...

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.960
Someone is impersonating Mei Jiulang.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.680
This teacup and the teapot in the kitchen are clearly a set.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.400
They must be exclusively for Mei Jiulang's use.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.600
Could someone

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.240
be trying to prevent Mei Jiulang from performing tonight?

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.440
They intended to tamper with the teapot,

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.320
but unexpectedly,

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.780
we accidentally broke it.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.360
Who exactly is trying to stop

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.650
Mei Jiulang from performing tonight?

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.360
Master Jiu,

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.090
you're back.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.100
Look at you trembling.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.640
What are you afraid of?

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.159
I'm here.

00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:55.490
I'll protect your life.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.040
I'm nervous.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.600
Finally.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.799
Finally my turn to sit here.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.720
Haha!

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:37.320
Senior.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.500
It's actually him.

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:42.120
Those people sitting down there watching the show today,

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.039
they claim to be your fans.

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:46.120
Haha!

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.200
I spit on that!

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.180
I deliberately misplaced my beauty mark today.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.400
Not a single person noticed.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.280
Their love for you is all fake.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.360
Haha!

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.400
What is Su Huasheng up to?

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.080
Where is Mei Jiulang?

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.640
Am I not

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.360
your most devoted fan?

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.320
It wasn't in vain that I spent

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.160
day and night imitating your singing style.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.120
This day

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.840
has finally come in handy.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:39.280
Oh, right.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.040
Senior.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.040
Today,

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.860
all the audience members were saying...

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.120
They said

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.400
Jiulang seems to sing better than before.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.040
Did you hear that?

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.720
Ten times better than you.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.280
No, not ten times.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.610
A hundred times better!

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.520
Who is it?

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:54.560
Jiulang.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.040
Who's there?

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.400
Hehe.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:02.970
It's the troupe master.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:03.640
What is it?

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.080
Jiulang.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.040
Today

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.180
the Minister is in a good mood.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.920
He says tonight

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.400
he wants to invite you

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.720
to perform at his mansion again.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:16.800
He also says

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.730
it's only been a few days

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.920
but your singing skills have improved considerably.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.920
The Minister really misses you.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:28.640
Alright.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:29.570
Get ready early.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.160
A carriage from his mansion will pick you up tonight.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.680
You'll certainly get your share of the reward.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.280
Sing well.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.800
Don't ruin our Ruichun Garden's reputation

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.240
or your own name.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.120
Don't worry.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.080
I won't ruin our reputation.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.880
You can see how much they love me.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:46.610
Alright.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.620
I need to get ready now.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.000
What is Su Huasheng up to?

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.880
Let's follow him and see.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:23.560
Boss, my leg is numb.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.220
Wait for me.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:28.640
Boss.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:05.340
Follow him.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.460
It's an ice cellar.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.160
I think so.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.680
Let's go down and take a look.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:22.960
What's wrong?

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:24.680
It's too high.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:25.850
Fear of heights?

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:28.400
Come here.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:30.410
Hold on to me.

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:32.620
Holding tight.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:38.160
We're here.
