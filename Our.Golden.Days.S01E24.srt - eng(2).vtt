WEBVTT

00:00:01.712 --> 00:00:03.012
You all know AP Group, right?

00:00:03.712 --> 00:00:05.112
The all-in-one interior materials company.

00:00:06.082 --> 00:00:08.682
That same AP Group has been put up for sale.

00:00:09.982 --> 00:00:11.252
And so...

00:00:12.952 --> 00:00:15.362
I've decided to acquire it.

00:00:21.432 --> 00:00:22.962
You mean AP Group?

00:00:25.532 --> 00:00:27.172
Wait, Mr. Lee.

00:00:28.172 --> 00:00:30.142
How could we possibly acquire a company that huge?

00:00:31.742 --> 00:00:32.742
Well...

00:00:33.312 --> 00:00:34.882
We'll just have to find a way.

00:00:36.312 --> 00:00:38.252
Mr. Jo and Cheol Min.

00:00:38.552 --> 00:00:39.652
Come to my office for a minute.

00:00:51.632 --> 00:00:53.062
Hey, Eun Oh.

00:00:53.862 --> 00:00:58.032
AP Group, as in the AP Group? The major interior materials firm.

00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:00.602
Yes, that's the one.

00:01:01.742 --> 00:01:05.612
Isn't that like a corner store owner trying to buy a department store?

00:01:07.642 --> 00:01:09.812
We did get the investment for the showroom,

00:01:10.142 --> 00:01:13.682
- so we're a local grocer then? - Anyway.

00:01:15.422 --> 00:01:19.122
Man, Ji Hyuk is all about money, you know?

00:01:19.192 --> 00:01:21.322
That whole thing with his marriage to Haneul Construction's daughter.

00:01:23.162 --> 00:01:24.562
That could be it.

00:01:25.462 --> 00:01:28.262
This is what sets a house apart. Didn't you say the details matter?

00:01:29.162 --> 00:01:33.672
My team would be thrilled to learn windows like these exist.

00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:35.442
You're awfully talkative today.

00:01:35.602 --> 00:01:38.272
I know, right? But things just keep coming to mind.

00:01:38.372 --> 00:01:39.712
This is what I enjoy.

00:01:42.212 --> 00:01:43.212
Or maybe...

00:01:44.412 --> 00:01:46.752
Maybe he's just doing it because he enjoys it.

00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:51.252
Seriously? He thinks acquiring AP Group is fun?

00:01:51.322 --> 00:01:52.522
I'm honestly terrified.

00:01:53.122 --> 00:01:56.822
Honestly, I was shocked back when he talked about the showroom.

00:01:58.022 --> 00:01:59.292
But he pulled it off, didn't he?

00:01:59.632 --> 00:02:00.662
He secured the investment, didn't he?

00:02:02.662 --> 00:02:03.702
You've got a point there.

00:02:06.072 --> 00:02:07.072
Maybe...

00:02:08.002 --> 00:02:11.042
he's one of those people who genuinely find business fun.

00:02:12.372 --> 00:02:14.772
(Shoealls)

00:02:14.842 --> 00:02:15.882
(Chief Director Park Seong Jae)

00:02:15.942 --> 00:02:19.112
Sir. Here's the prototype shortlist.

00:02:19.812 --> 00:02:20.812
Okay, thank you.

00:02:23.152 --> 00:02:24.182
You've got company.

00:02:31.122 --> 00:02:32.892
You want to acquire AP Group?

00:02:33.232 --> 00:02:34.262
Are you out of your mind?

00:02:35.902 --> 00:02:38.572
This was my planned next step after the showroom.

00:02:38.772 --> 00:02:41.102
A company that produces a full line of interior products.

00:02:45.572 --> 00:02:47.972
If you want out, I'll let you out of the contract.

00:02:48.282 --> 00:02:49.342
I'll give you your money back, too.

00:02:50.082 --> 00:02:52.752
Ji Hyuk, you feel bad about this, don't you?

00:02:59.422 --> 00:03:02.992
You'd return three million dollars? When you need every penny?

00:03:03.522 --> 00:03:06.632
You invested in the showroom, and I'm abandoning that plan...

00:03:06.692 --> 00:03:08.502
to acquire AP Group instead.

00:03:09.462 --> 00:03:10.802
Think it over and let me know.

00:03:11.532 --> 00:03:13.672
Why? Are you planning to write another proposal?

00:03:14.902 --> 00:03:16.742
- You monster. - What?

00:03:16.802 --> 00:03:19.712
Look at your eyes right now. They're sparkling.

00:03:20.272 --> 00:03:21.572
You're excited about this one too, aren't you?

00:03:22.182 --> 00:03:24.812
What's there to be excited about? We haven't even started.

00:03:26.282 --> 00:03:27.852
Found an advisory firm yet?

00:03:28.382 --> 00:03:29.522
I'm reaching out to some.

00:03:31.692 --> 00:03:33.592
Let me make an introduction.

00:03:34.452 --> 00:03:38.462
Though Mamdaerozip has grown quickly and secured second-round funding,

00:03:39.392 --> 00:03:42.632
if you try to acquire AP Group with the capital you have now,

00:03:43.232 --> 00:03:45.032
no one in the industry will touch it.

00:03:45.732 --> 00:03:47.502
You know as well as I do that it's a reckless move.

00:03:48.442 --> 00:03:50.202
Fine, make the introduction. You're right.

00:03:50.902 --> 00:03:53.312
- Okay, I'll tell you right away. - Okay, thanks.

00:03:57.042 --> 00:03:58.651
Go and claim Eun Oh right now.

00:03:58.652 --> 00:04:00.212
And make sure I don't get the chance.

00:04:01.582 --> 00:04:02.582
Ji Hyuk.

00:04:07.422 --> 00:04:09.862
I need some more time.

00:04:11.932 --> 00:04:14.692
If I don't tell Eun Oh how I feel right away,

00:04:15.532 --> 00:04:16.702
are you going to tell her how you feel?

00:04:19.002 --> 00:04:20.002
I'm not sure.

00:04:23.742 --> 00:04:24.772
I might.

00:04:27.842 --> 00:04:29.012
She'll probably turn you down.

00:04:30.512 --> 00:04:31.782
If I can't hold it in anymore,

00:04:33.052 --> 00:04:34.182
I guess I'll have to say something.

00:04:34.582 --> 00:04:36.352
I thought you were busy trying to acquire AP Group.

00:04:36.622 --> 00:04:37.722
Do you really have time for this?

00:04:38.892 --> 00:04:41.222
For now, I'm going to work on the acquisition.

00:04:55.272 --> 00:04:58.472
Okay, Chief. Today, we're removing the kitchen, ceiling,

00:04:58.542 --> 00:04:59.872
and flooring...

00:04:59.942 --> 00:05:03.382
And we'll cut the exterior door to the rental unit!

00:05:04.712 --> 00:05:07.412
- You can get started. - All right, let's get to it.

00:05:07.482 --> 00:05:09.382
- Right. - Let's start over there.

00:05:10.652 --> 00:05:12.892
- Ms. Ji. - One, two!

00:05:13.322 --> 00:05:15.722
All right, careful now. Over that way.

00:05:17.822 --> 00:05:18.832
My gosh.

00:05:19.432 --> 00:05:21.632
Ma'am. What brings you here so early?

00:05:21.832 --> 00:05:24.832
Meet my sister and nephew. They were on their way to work...

00:05:24.902 --> 00:05:26.932
and wanted to see the place one last time.

00:05:27.232 --> 00:05:28.372
I see.

00:05:28.802 --> 00:05:30.672
- Hello. - Hello.

00:05:30.972 --> 00:05:33.542
This is my aunt's house. I used to visit a lot as a kid.

00:05:33.912 --> 00:05:36.842
I was sad to hear it was changing, so I came for a look.

00:05:37.442 --> 00:05:40.982
I know the feeling. After I left my long time home,

00:05:41.182 --> 00:05:42.782
I went back to visit a few times by myself.

00:05:43.552 --> 00:05:47.422
It's just sad to think this is the last time.

00:05:47.692 --> 00:05:50.962
I actually took some pictures. Should I send them to you?

00:05:51.992 --> 00:05:53.592
You took pictures?

00:05:53.762 --> 00:05:55.932
Yes. Just in case,

00:05:56.032 --> 00:05:57.962
I came by yesterday and took a bunch.

00:05:58.472 --> 00:06:01.232
See? She's so young,

00:06:01.372 --> 00:06:03.242
but she's incredibly thoughtful.

00:06:09.212 --> 00:06:10.212
It's me.

00:06:25.162 --> 00:06:27.592
Salad for lunch, or something else?

00:06:27.862 --> 00:06:30.402
Why do you keep asking every day? You know the answer.

00:06:30.532 --> 00:06:33.672
You could be getting married any day now.

00:06:34.032 --> 00:06:35.701
Shouldn't you be watching your weight?

00:06:35.702 --> 00:06:36.742
You said you gained a kilo.

00:06:36.802 --> 00:06:38.272
I'm not having salad.

00:06:38.842 --> 00:06:40.142
Then what are you having?

00:06:43.312 --> 00:06:44.312
Ji Wan.

00:06:44.582 --> 00:06:48.652
Why are you so mad that I'm marrying up?

00:06:49.222 --> 00:06:50.282
Why should you care?

00:06:50.522 --> 00:06:55.122
I'm not mad. I feel bad for you. Can't you see?

00:06:55.662 --> 00:07:00.092
Fine, whatever. Forget it. Go live like a princess in a tower.

00:07:00.292 --> 00:07:01.832
I'm done caring.

00:07:02.402 --> 00:07:04.102
Just finish the webtoon before you get married.

00:07:10.202 --> 00:07:11.472
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:07:11.942 --> 00:07:16.042
Is that too much to ask? I've been helping you with the plot.

00:07:16.312 --> 00:07:18.882
The least you can do is let me see how it ends.

00:07:19.612 --> 00:07:20.852
Don't you have any loyalty?

00:07:23.252 --> 00:07:24.352
Lee Sang Hoon...

00:07:24.682 --> 00:07:28.052
He's on a business trip overseas. He'll be back in two weeks.

00:07:29.292 --> 00:07:32.062
- So? - You said it might be nice...

00:07:32.492 --> 00:07:35.362
if Dokgo Chan and Ko So Ri crossed paths once by chance...

00:07:35.432 --> 00:07:37.262
before the zombie incident.

00:07:38.032 --> 00:07:41.202
Something about spilling ramyeon by the Han River?

00:07:42.172 --> 00:07:43.172
Yes.

00:07:45.412 --> 00:07:47.712
But I've never actually seen someone...

00:07:48.012 --> 00:07:51.342
- make one of those ramyeon there. - As if that's the only thing.

00:07:51.912 --> 00:07:53.412
Let's go! To the Han River.

00:07:57.182 --> 00:07:58.792
(Park Yeong Ra, Yeong Ra's Car)

00:08:03.492 --> 00:08:04.562
Director Ko.

00:08:13.072 --> 00:08:14.272
You've been waiting.

00:08:14.472 --> 00:08:18.442
Of course. The one who asked you out should arrive first.

00:08:19.442 --> 00:08:21.472
I looked up a few restaurants nearby.

00:08:21.542 --> 00:08:24.042
You said we could take two hours for lunch, right?

00:08:24.982 --> 00:08:26.512
And it's such a beautiful day.

00:08:32.122 --> 00:08:33.852
This thing really boils it?

00:08:33.992 --> 00:08:36.592
That's right. Get a shot when it starts to boil.

00:08:36.822 --> 00:08:38.162
Get the scenery, too.

00:08:38.522 --> 00:08:40.032
Here, let me do it.

00:08:40.592 --> 00:08:41.592
Okay.

00:08:43.132 --> 00:08:44.562
Let's see...

00:08:46.572 --> 00:08:47.572
Oh, my.

00:08:48.432 --> 00:08:49.442
My gosh!

00:08:50.772 --> 00:08:52.472
It's boiling! Ji Wan!

00:08:52.942 --> 00:08:53.942
It's boiling.

00:08:55.382 --> 00:08:56.382
Wow.

00:08:58.582 --> 00:08:59.782
Oh, my.

00:09:00.252 --> 00:09:02.622
It's really boiling! It's actually boiling.

00:09:11.562 --> 00:09:14.032
This is really good, Ji Wan.

00:09:14.292 --> 00:09:16.602
Everything tastes better when you eat it outside.

00:09:16.662 --> 00:09:19.732
That's just how it is. It's why people go on picnics...

00:09:19.802 --> 00:09:23.272
- and camping. - That makes sense.

00:09:23.542 --> 00:09:25.842
Hurry and eat up. We've got to go ride those bikes.

00:09:26.742 --> 00:09:28.512
Should I add bike-riding to the episode?

00:09:28.572 --> 00:09:31.712
No. Since you could be married off soon,

00:09:31.782 --> 00:09:32.782
I figured while we're out,

00:09:33.052 --> 00:09:35.252
I'd show you a little more of what the world has to offer.

00:09:37.782 --> 00:09:38.952
You poor thing.

00:09:55.842 --> 00:09:57.572
Hey, what are you doing?

00:09:57.972 --> 00:10:00.072
What are you, a glutton for punishment?

00:10:00.442 --> 00:10:01.442
Don't your legs hurt?

00:10:01.812 --> 00:10:02.842
They do.

00:10:03.482 --> 00:10:04.812
They do, but...

00:10:07.352 --> 00:10:08.382
It's fun.

00:10:08.952 --> 00:10:12.122
- Your calves are going to be sore. - What?

00:10:14.492 --> 00:10:15.492
Hang on...

00:10:15.962 --> 00:10:17.291
- Here, Yeong Ra. - What?

00:10:17.292 --> 00:10:20.132
Let's switch seats. Up front, you'll get a great view,

00:10:20.192 --> 00:10:21.262
so you'll see everything much better.

00:10:21.892 --> 00:10:22.902
You think so?

00:10:25.502 --> 00:10:29.372
This is my first time on a bike, but with you, I'm not scared at all.

00:10:30.142 --> 00:10:34.172
Don't pedal. Just enjoy the scenery. I'll take care of the pedals.

00:10:34.442 --> 00:10:36.682
- Okay. - Be careful.

00:10:39.112 --> 00:10:40.112
Let's go.

00:10:40.382 --> 00:10:41.452
Here we go!

00:10:48.292 --> 00:10:49.322
Oh, my!

00:10:49.822 --> 00:10:52.492
I've never seen a homemade lunch like this.

00:10:54.292 --> 00:10:58.332
I felt so bad, and I had to find a way to show you.

00:10:58.832 --> 00:11:00.932
So I made you this lunch.

00:11:01.602 --> 00:11:05.572
When you make something by hand, you put your heart into it.

00:11:06.812 --> 00:11:09.012
You made all of this yourself?

00:11:11.142 --> 00:11:14.412
Director Ko, you didn't have to do all this.

00:11:15.082 --> 00:11:18.022
I told you my story too, remember?

00:11:18.682 --> 00:11:20.992
But I'm the older one here.

00:11:22.022 --> 00:11:23.022
Here...

00:11:24.162 --> 00:11:25.192
Have a bite.

00:11:31.002 --> 00:11:32.432
This one's my favourite.

00:11:33.832 --> 00:11:35.332
I love shrimp fritters, too.

00:11:59.192 --> 00:12:00.292
Is something wrong?

00:12:01.232 --> 00:12:02.232
No, it's just...

00:12:02.732 --> 00:12:04.062
The scent...

00:12:06.432 --> 00:12:07.602
Just a moment.

00:12:12.512 --> 00:12:15.442
(Park Yeong Ra, Studio)

00:12:21.352 --> 00:12:24.482
- How is it? - It's delicious.

00:12:25.622 --> 00:12:26.692
Please, eat up.

00:13:20.042 --> 00:13:21.272
You know, Eun Oh...

00:13:21.942 --> 00:13:24.012
I was just thinking about something.

00:13:26.082 --> 00:13:28.382
We may feel like friends,

00:13:28.782 --> 00:13:31.182
but you're young enough to be my daughter.

00:13:31.582 --> 00:13:35.962
I wonder why I told you a secret I've never told anyone. And twice.

00:13:36.962 --> 00:13:40.332
I mentioned why before.

00:13:40.732 --> 00:13:41.732
Anyway,

00:13:42.032 --> 00:13:43.362
I have no idea why today...

00:13:43.832 --> 00:13:46.772
I just bared my soul about my past.

00:13:46.872 --> 00:13:50.742
That's because I'm not involved with anyone in your life.

00:13:51.172 --> 00:13:52.172
After all,

00:13:52.742 --> 00:13:55.642
I told you all about my brother, didn't I?

00:13:57.142 --> 00:13:58.282
That's right.

00:13:58.642 --> 00:14:01.782
You were the one who first told me about being adopted.

00:14:04.522 --> 00:14:06.852
That must have been a secret you were hiding.

00:14:08.552 --> 00:14:11.192
I wasn't actively trying to hide it.

00:14:13.192 --> 00:14:15.732
The fact is, my birth parents abandoned me,

00:14:16.262 --> 00:14:18.062
and the mom and dad who raised me...

00:14:18.362 --> 00:14:20.472
were my real parents.

00:14:21.032 --> 00:14:23.872
So there was never any reason to mention it.

00:14:25.142 --> 00:14:26.142
Really?

00:14:27.612 --> 00:14:30.682
I'm telling you. I grew up surrounded by love.

00:14:31.382 --> 00:14:32.882
But still,

00:14:33.152 --> 00:14:35.752
you must have thought about your birth parents.

00:14:36.182 --> 00:14:39.592
Didn't you ever miss them or wonder about them?

00:14:40.292 --> 00:14:43.792
Whatever the reason, they still abandoned me.

00:14:44.892 --> 00:14:47.192
What's there to be curious about?

00:14:47.832 --> 00:14:49.032
Listen to you.

00:14:51.062 --> 00:14:52.672
What if they didn't abandon you,

00:14:53.102 --> 00:14:54.832
but lost you instead?

00:14:58.202 --> 00:15:01.772
But I was told they left me at an orphanage.

00:15:03.082 --> 00:15:06.752
On TV shows and posters,

00:15:07.012 --> 00:15:09.752
kids get lost on the street, at markets, or in neighbourhoods,

00:15:09.822 --> 00:15:12.222
and there are so many cases where they're never found.

00:15:13.092 --> 00:15:16.522
There are stories about parents searching orphanages nationwide.

00:15:20.892 --> 00:15:21.892
Right.

00:15:25.232 --> 00:15:26.902
Even someone like me...

00:15:28.202 --> 00:15:33.072
I registered my DNA with the police, just in case.

00:15:34.742 --> 00:15:36.382
Even though she's dead?

00:15:39.382 --> 00:15:40.882
She must be dead by now.

00:15:43.922 --> 00:15:45.722
You never know.

00:15:46.392 --> 00:15:49.492
Someone could have taken her before the fire.

00:16:00.202 --> 00:16:02.872
This is something I'll probably never be able...

00:16:06.072 --> 00:16:07.512
to give up on until the day I die.

00:16:10.512 --> 00:16:12.042
That's how mothers are.

00:16:17.282 --> 00:16:18.622
So, a mother...

00:16:19.122 --> 00:16:20.522
is like that.

00:16:26.762 --> 00:16:28.231
He was my senior in the MBA program.

00:16:28.232 --> 00:16:30.632

And Attorney Choi Jong Gu, our legal counsel.

My goal was to reach AP Group's position in the industry.

00:16:44.912 --> 00:16:47.952
Why take ten years to get somewhere you can reach in one?

00:16:49.222 --> 00:16:52.252
- So you're set on acquiring it. - The problem is,

00:16:52.822 --> 00:16:54.952
it comes down to the numbers.

00:16:55.922 --> 00:17:00.062

Yes. This is Kim Jang Su.

You sound like you've caught a cold.

00:17:54.582 --> 00:17:56.352
Sounds like a nasty one.

00:17:58.252 --> 00:18:01.952
I was in so much pain, I didn't even think to call.

00:18:03.062 --> 00:18:07.132
If you're that sick, you should've called your daughter.

00:18:07.432 --> 00:18:09.302
Goodness, no.

00:18:16.102 --> 00:18:17.472
Fine.

00:18:18.542 --> 00:18:21.112
Yes, I heard you. I'm hanging up now.

Ok Rye, what are you doing here?

00:18:29.452 --> 00:18:33.452
I brought you medicine and a tonic. You haven't eaten, have you?

00:18:34.692 --> 00:18:37.492
Forget it. Just give me the medicine.

00:18:38.692 --> 00:18:40.392
We just agreed to be friends.

00:18:40.692 --> 00:18:44.362
What kind of friend would I be if I let you take it without eating?

00:18:44.432 --> 00:18:46.002
For goodness' sake.

00:18:54.072 --> 00:18:56.412

Jang Su, your daughter can't visit even if you call.

00:19:21.972 --> 00:19:25.502
Mother, my father can never find out...

00:19:25.572 --> 00:19:26.742
that I'm working.

00:19:28.842 --> 00:19:31.642
It's because I'm hiding something, too.

00:19:31.982 --> 00:19:36.322
Now, hurry and eat. You need to eat before your medicine.

00:19:41.892 --> 00:19:46.262
If I were just five years younger, I'd have made you a better meal.

00:19:46.532 --> 00:19:48.062
But I was in such a rush.

00:19:48.762 --> 00:19:52.262
Still, this is very nutritious.

00:19:53.602 --> 00:19:56.902

I miss my grandkids in the US so much.

00:20:32.102 --> 00:20:34.312
I was lying here sick all alone,

00:20:35.012 --> 00:20:36.542
and I thought,

00:20:36.612 --> 00:20:40.252
"Will I die without ever seeing my son and grandkids again?"

00:20:41.712 --> 00:20:44.982
"Was that my fate?"

00:20:58.332 --> 00:21:01.072

Mr. Jung, you have to watch where you're going.

00:21:13.112 --> 00:21:14.412
- Goodness. - Oh, no! Da Jeong!

00:21:14.712 --> 00:21:16.681
- Oh, this is terrible. My goodness. - What have I done?

00:21:16.682 --> 00:21:18.022
Are you okay, Da Jeong?

00:21:19.822 --> 00:21:23.362
It's a mild second-degree burn and won't leave a scar,

00:21:23.462 --> 00:21:24.992
so that's a huge relief.

00:21:25.492 --> 00:21:28.162
It's okay. I know you didn't do it on purpose.

00:21:28.262 --> 00:21:31.132
You acted like you owned the place, saying you were a regular.

00:21:31.202 --> 00:21:34.602
I feel terrible you can't work now, all because of me.

00:21:35.332 --> 00:21:39.612
Mr. Shin. Didn't you say you were hiring?

00:21:39.672 --> 00:21:40.672
Yes.

00:21:44.042 --> 00:21:47.782
Thanks to you, I met the advisors. The meeting went great.

00:21:48.912 --> 00:21:51.752
Yes, Sung Guk already told me, you punk.

00:21:53.322 --> 00:21:56.722

Go ahead and pick some out.

No, just bring me the three lightest pairs you have.

00:22:39.472 --> 00:22:42.102
- In size 240mm. - Please have a seat.

00:22:59.522 --> 00:23:02.722
- Please try these on. - Those are the wrong ones.

00:23:09.392 --> 00:23:10.402
These feel heavy.

You know those two aren't the right ones.

Whatever, they're all pretty much the same.

00:23:31.622 --> 00:23:32.922
What do you mean "they're all pretty much the same?"

00:23:33.352 --> 00:23:36.762
I gave you the file listing it all. Product, colour, features, weight...

Why haven't you memorized it?

00:23:38.992 --> 00:23:42.032
And I told you to first ask what they'll be using them for.

00:23:42.292 --> 00:23:44.202
You can't just say, "Have a look. They're all lightweight."

00:23:44.602 --> 00:23:45.602
Why are you being like this?

00:23:45.902 --> 00:23:48.072

"Get over here?"

00:24:37.582 --> 00:24:38.982
You've got to be kidding me.

00:24:39.752 --> 00:24:41.792
Are you that desperate to become a full-time employee?

00:24:42.192 --> 00:24:44.662
What, you think they'll give you a special offer if you do that?

00:24:45.562 --> 00:24:47.431
- What? - You're a part-timer,

00:24:47.432 --> 00:24:49.462
so don't lecture a full-timer.

00:24:50.032 --> 00:24:54.172
- Just mind your own business. - If you don't want my lectures,

00:24:54.602 --> 00:24:56.132
then act like a full-time employee.

00:24:56.472 --> 00:24:57.972
Show some responsibility.

00:24:58.372 --> 00:24:59.612
And stop slacking off.

00:25:00.172 --> 00:25:01.642
Believe me, I'd love to be out of here already.

00:25:02.312 --> 00:25:04.512
But I can't, because you're completely useless.

00:25:05.182 --> 00:25:06.952
What? "Useless?"

00:25:08.312 --> 00:25:10.151
First, dust the shoes on display.

00:25:10.152 --> 00:25:12.992
And stop tossing the shoes customers tried on.

00:25:13.122 --> 00:25:16.022
Place them at the correct angle. You can't even get that right.

00:25:16.092 --> 00:25:17.362
Because you're useless!

00:25:17.692 --> 00:25:18.722
Why you little...

00:25:22.132 --> 00:25:24.262
- You little what? - What?

00:25:26.832 --> 00:25:27.832
What?

00:25:32.442 --> 00:25:33.442
You're really asking for it.

00:25:33.512 --> 00:25:37.212
Kim Min Ji! What are you doing? Hey, stop it!

00:25:37.282 --> 00:25:40.082
- Hold on. Stop it. Stop! - No, she started it.

00:25:40.682 --> 00:25:41.682
She started it!

00:25:42.412 --> 00:25:43.422
Let me go. What are you doing?

00:25:43.722 --> 00:25:44.722
Gosh, seriously!

00:25:44.852 --> 00:25:45.852
(Shoealls)

00:25:47.422 --> 00:25:49.662
Su Bin. What on earth just happened?

00:25:51.522 --> 00:25:52.522
What?

00:25:54.692 --> 00:25:55.762
Let me see.

00:26:09.012 --> 00:26:10.112
You've got a scratch.

00:26:12.412 --> 00:26:13.412
Hey, you!

00:26:13.482 --> 00:26:15.181
Stop! Are you crazy?

00:26:15.182 --> 00:26:16.822
You're the chief director of the company.

00:26:20.222 --> 00:26:21.422
I'll handle her.

00:26:27.532 --> 00:26:28.532
Let's go.

00:26:48.482 --> 00:26:49.552
My goodness.

00:26:57.392 --> 00:26:58.692
Thankfully, it won't leave a scar.

00:27:00.032 --> 00:27:01.432
That girl has such long nails.

00:27:02.692 --> 00:27:03.702
Hey, Lee Su Bin.

00:27:04.232 --> 00:27:05.661
Why did you just stand there?

00:27:05.662 --> 00:27:06.672
She grabbed your hair, and you froze.

00:27:07.232 --> 00:27:08.232
Are you a fool?

00:27:08.832 --> 00:27:11.102
What if I fought back, and she got hurt?

00:27:11.502 --> 00:27:13.712
If people found out you got me this job,

00:27:14.142 --> 00:27:15.472
you'd be in a really tough spot.

00:27:17.182 --> 00:27:18.482
So you just stood there and took it?

00:27:18.982 --> 00:27:19.982
Because of me?

00:27:20.482 --> 00:27:21.482
Yes.

00:27:31.592 --> 00:27:33.962
Hey, that's why I told you to quit the moment your replacement arrived.

00:27:39.972 --> 00:27:41.702
It was the least I could do to repay the favour.

00:27:42.032 --> 00:27:45.642
You got me the business cards and even let me work at the store.

00:27:46.102 --> 00:27:47.342
And the store manager helped me out, too.

00:27:47.712 --> 00:27:50.212
That's why I wanted to train the new hire properly.

00:27:55.212 --> 00:27:56.852
I can't exactly say you did the right thing,

00:27:57.152 --> 00:27:58.352
but I can't exactly thank you either.

00:27:59.382 --> 00:28:00.652
You're so unpredictable, Lee Su Bin.

00:28:05.762 --> 00:28:06.762
Let me see.

00:28:12.562 --> 00:28:13.572
Are you okay?

00:28:15.472 --> 00:28:16.472
Yes.

00:28:28.082 --> 00:28:29.612
My gosh, you must be out of your mind!

00:28:31.482 --> 00:28:33.492
The broth in those pots is scalding hot!

00:28:35.292 --> 00:28:37.222
Your husband is going to flip out when he finds out.

00:28:37.992 --> 00:28:41.692
That's why I'm showing you now, so he and the kids won't know.

00:28:42.132 --> 00:28:44.862
See? You can't even tell as long as my sleeves are down.

00:28:45.062 --> 00:28:48.672
Goodness, do you just have secrets to hide everywhere?

00:28:50.842 --> 00:28:53.772
How did you end up having to work at a restaurant?

00:28:54.372 --> 00:28:56.582
It's normal for both parents to work these days.

00:28:57.142 --> 00:28:58.782
Especially after retirement.

00:29:00.152 --> 00:29:01.952
It's not like I only ever took care of your family.

00:29:02.712 --> 00:29:06.122
My mother had dementia for 15 years and a stroke, as you know.

00:29:07.452 --> 00:29:08.452
What about your sister?

00:29:09.252 --> 00:29:10.992
Is she living well in the US?

00:29:12.662 --> 00:29:14.262
How long has it been since she last visited Korea?

00:29:16.192 --> 00:29:17.202
Five years.

00:29:18.562 --> 00:29:20.032
Has it really been five years already?

00:29:22.002 --> 00:29:23.802
Her kids must have grown up a lot.

00:29:25.372 --> 00:29:26.942
They're in 9th grade and 10th grade.

00:29:28.042 --> 00:29:30.342
But why the sudden questions about my sister?

00:29:30.912 --> 00:29:33.312
No reason. I just thought of her.

00:29:34.912 --> 00:29:38.522
I figured your father must miss her terribly.

00:29:40.422 --> 00:29:41.422
Yes, I'm sure.

00:29:43.662 --> 00:29:46.632
Listen, dear. I'll take care of the soup and things,

00:29:46.732 --> 00:29:48.892
so you just set the table.

00:29:49.862 --> 00:29:52.002
Okay, I'll take you up on that for a few days. Thank you.

00:30:03.682 --> 00:30:05.312
Thanks for the ride home.

00:30:16.352 --> 00:30:17.362
It might fester.

00:30:18.392 --> 00:30:19.492
I just touched the bandage.

00:30:21.632 --> 00:30:22.962
Make sure you get a proper apology tomorrow.

00:30:23.532 --> 00:30:25.332
Then you work one more day, and you're done.

00:30:27.132 --> 00:30:28.132
Okay.

00:30:31.342 --> 00:30:33.272
What? I got a text.

00:30:34.872 --> 00:30:36.782
Su Bin, it's Seok.

00:30:37.542 --> 00:30:40.852
I guess I'm still not over you.

00:30:41.782 --> 00:30:43.152
What a psycho.

00:30:44.282 --> 00:30:45.282
Who's that?

00:30:45.682 --> 00:30:46.722
A stalker?

00:30:47.152 --> 00:30:48.652
No, my ex.

00:30:49.152 --> 00:30:50.691
He saw my channel and wouldn't stop calling,

00:30:50.692 --> 00:30:52.662
so I blocked him. I guess he's using someone else's phone.

00:30:53.532 --> 00:30:54.532
Your ex?

00:30:55.292 --> 00:30:56.392
But it was bad enough to block him?

00:30:57.802 --> 00:31:00.072
- You didn't really like him, then. - That's not true.

00:31:00.402 --> 00:31:02.902
I was crazy about him for a whole year.

00:31:03.902 --> 00:31:04.972
You liked him that much?

00:31:05.272 --> 00:31:07.372
Yes. I loved him.

00:31:07.772 --> 00:31:09.072
Then why break up after only a year?

00:31:09.512 --> 00:31:10.742
You just said you were madly in love.

00:31:12.142 --> 00:31:15.752
For a guy who's been divorced, you sound surprisingly naive.

00:31:17.482 --> 00:31:20.052
You don't fall in love for a reason, or know why you've fallen out of it.

00:31:20.392 --> 00:31:22.192
That's love. Not even understanding your own heart.

00:31:22.692 --> 00:31:24.262
What do you mean there's no reason?

00:31:24.892 --> 00:31:27.132
You must like something about them. There's always a reason.

00:31:27.692 --> 00:31:31.832
That's when you first like someone. With true love, there is no "why."

00:31:32.602 --> 00:31:35.672
You think about them all day, miss them, want to claim them,

00:31:35.772 --> 00:31:37.442
and worry someone else might take them away.

00:31:40.172 --> 00:31:41.172
And then what?

00:31:42.242 --> 00:31:43.242
What do you mean, "And then what?"

00:31:43.582 --> 00:31:44.582
What comes next?

00:31:45.212 --> 00:31:46.782
You confess, of course. What else?

00:31:47.512 --> 00:31:48.852
You're being really weird.

00:31:49.312 --> 00:31:50.752
But there's also the kind of love you have to endure.

00:31:51.022 --> 00:31:54.322
For their sake, because you feel you're not good enough,

00:31:54.992 --> 00:31:58.362
or you can't make them happy. Holding back is still love, right?

00:31:58.492 --> 00:32:02.562
Because you're scared to confess, or because the feeling is bearable.

00:32:02.892 --> 00:32:03.902
No, that's not it.

00:32:04.562 --> 00:32:08.002
Look, fine. What if you're scared of rejection?

00:32:08.172 --> 00:32:09.332
Is that not love?

00:32:10.242 --> 00:32:11.242
My point is,

00:32:11.972 --> 00:32:14.912
wanting to protect someone from afar without them ever knowing.

00:32:15.312 --> 00:32:16.572
That's a Daddy-Long-Legs kind of love.

00:32:22.112 --> 00:32:26.422
I asked you why you got married, and you said you were lonely.

00:32:28.952 --> 00:32:31.522
You've never been in real love, have you?

00:32:31.922 --> 00:32:33.862
Love is about possession.

00:32:34.232 --> 00:32:35.232
A love you can "endure?"

00:32:35.492 --> 00:32:38.302
How could you endure it? It's impossible to hold back.

00:32:38.732 --> 00:32:40.202
It always shows.

00:32:40.572 --> 00:32:44.142
Three things can't be hidden. Love, poverty, and a sneeze.

00:32:47.212 --> 00:32:50.142
Are you really in love with her? How could you hold back for years?

00:32:50.442 --> 00:32:51.512
I can't hold back.

00:32:52.242 --> 00:32:53.452
I just can't bring myself to.

00:32:54.082 --> 00:32:57.222
I want to tell Eun Oh right now. How could anyone hold that in?

00:33:02.452 --> 00:33:04.362
Wait, what was that? Don't tell me...

00:33:05.022 --> 00:33:06.622
Was all of that about you, Seong Jae?

00:33:07.792 --> 00:33:08.792
What?

00:33:10.902 --> 00:33:11.902
No.

00:33:12.232 --> 00:33:13.232
You should get inside.

00:33:14.232 --> 00:33:15.232
Who is she?

00:33:15.602 --> 00:33:16.602
Just get out of the car.

00:33:28.952 --> 00:33:31.022
You asked me to tell you when Ji Hyuk broke up...

00:33:32.522 --> 00:33:33.522
with his latest girlfriend.

00:33:40.192 --> 00:33:41.192
At the company,

00:33:41.962 --> 00:33:43.762
I'm going to make myself completely indispensable.

00:33:44.232 --> 00:33:46.331
So that my father can't function without me.

00:33:46.332 --> 00:33:47.372
And then,

00:33:48.332 --> 00:33:49.732
I'm going to tell Eun Oh how I feel.

00:33:50.002 --> 00:33:51.002
Go and claim Eun Oh right now.

00:33:51.602 --> 00:33:52.972
And make sure I don't get the chance.

00:33:56.842 --> 00:33:57.842
I endured it well.

00:33:58.982 --> 00:33:59.982
I...

00:34:01.052 --> 00:34:02.052
kept my cool.

00:34:08.752 --> 00:34:12.192
(Auditor's Report on Consolidated Financial Statements)

00:34:22.032 --> 00:34:23.302
I'd better go home.

00:34:38.682 --> 00:34:39.682
There he goes again.

00:34:42.952 --> 00:34:45.492
Dad, are you okay?

00:34:47.292 --> 00:34:49.662
Why are you calling out to me? We agreed to act like strangers.

00:34:52.162 --> 00:34:54.802
I called out because I was afraid you'd trip on your laces again.

00:34:57.072 --> 00:34:58.072
Seriously, Dad.

00:34:58.402 --> 00:35:00.272
Why can't you ever tie your shoes properly?

00:35:07.412 --> 00:35:09.912
Stop wearing these sneakers.

00:35:11.422 --> 00:35:14.022
I'll stop by the convenience store. You go on inside.

00:35:17.522 --> 00:35:18.722
What's he talking about?

00:35:23.162 --> 00:35:25.832
That I almost tripped over my shoelaces again?

00:35:27.472 --> 00:35:30.201
That kid... When has he ever seen me trip on laces...

00:35:30.202 --> 00:35:31.642
and almost fall?

00:35:34.172 --> 00:35:37.142
(Mamdaerozip)

00:35:42.652 --> 00:35:45.982
You should check on him instead of just taking his word for it.

00:35:46.622 --> 00:35:48.292
Running a business isn't that easy.

00:35:49.692 --> 00:35:51.762
Whatever. I'm staying out of it.

00:35:53.492 --> 00:35:55.592
Why are you acting all concerned all of a sudden?

00:35:57.002 --> 00:35:58.262
What do you mean, "acting?"

00:35:58.932 --> 00:35:59.932
Am I wrong?

00:36:00.632 --> 00:36:03.132
If you're so worried, you tell him yourself.

00:36:03.902 --> 00:36:06.672
Why would I ever say something like that to him?

00:36:12.182 --> 00:36:13.182
Ji Hyuk!

00:36:16.352 --> 00:36:17.352
What's this?

00:36:18.782 --> 00:36:19.782
Beer?

00:36:20.322 --> 00:36:21.552
Two? You knew I was coming?

00:36:22.922 --> 00:36:24.522
Come and have one in my room.

00:36:25.122 --> 00:36:26.191
Just for a little while.

00:36:26.192 --> 00:36:28.332
Okay. To your expanding business empire,

00:36:28.432 --> 00:36:30.302
I shall gladly make a swift exit.

00:36:33.362 --> 00:36:34.432
Am I wrong?

00:36:35.332 --> 00:36:38.702
After his wedding got cancelled and he left home.

00:36:39.302 --> 00:36:41.312
You weren't worried about Ji Hyuk, not even once.

00:36:44.282 --> 00:36:47.282
Our eldest son ran out of the house in shock,

00:36:47.612 --> 00:36:49.582
and he was gone for over a month.

00:36:49.982 --> 00:36:52.752
Did you once even ask where he was or say you were worried?

00:36:53.822 --> 00:36:56.352
I didn't say anything because I wasn't worried.

00:36:56.622 --> 00:36:58.562
It's because Seong Jae never came by.

00:36:59.992 --> 00:37:01.692
Why are you suddenly bringing up Seong Jae?

00:37:03.332 --> 00:37:06.802
Ji Hyuk caused that huge mess and ran away from home.

00:37:07.172 --> 00:37:09.632
You think a guy like Seong Jae wouldn't come check on us?

00:37:10.542 --> 00:37:13.472
He's the type who just shows up and helps himself to a meal.

00:37:15.512 --> 00:37:19.882
Seong Jae knew where Ji Hyuk was, so he couldn't visit.

00:37:20.212 --> 00:37:24.122
Because if he came and we asked him, he couldn't lie.

00:37:27.022 --> 00:37:28.122
That makes sense.

00:37:29.952 --> 00:37:31.492
You should have told me, then.

00:37:32.392 --> 00:37:35.432
I just assumed you were secretly in touch with him.

00:37:36.532 --> 00:37:39.432
So that's why you pretended you weren't worried about him.

00:37:39.802 --> 00:37:40.972
Because you had it all figured out?

00:37:53.612 --> 00:37:55.152
Dad's intuition is insane!

00:37:56.682 --> 00:37:58.622
How did he even think to connect it to Seong Jae?

00:37:59.582 --> 00:38:00.592
Tell me about it.

00:38:01.022 --> 00:38:02.792
I guess that's how he made it all the way to retirement.

00:38:03.292 --> 00:38:06.122
So Seong Jae really knew where you were the whole time?

00:38:07.262 --> 00:38:08.262
Yes.

00:38:09.362 --> 00:38:13.002
My gosh. Dad's like Sherlock Holmes.

00:38:14.702 --> 00:38:16.302
So he was worried about me after all.

00:38:24.682 --> 00:38:26.942
I called out because I was afraid you'd trip on your laces again.

00:38:29.212 --> 00:38:33.752
But that time, I tripped on my laces and almost fell?

00:38:36.092 --> 00:38:37.392
That foggy

00:38:38.192 --> 00:38:39.422
Darn...

00:38:41.832 --> 00:38:43.392
Right, it was then.

00:38:44.232 --> 00:38:47.032
So he came to check on us back then?

00:38:48.132 --> 00:38:49.732
This is for your birthday.

00:38:50.602 --> 00:38:52.272
I figured you could use some comfortable shoes.

00:38:54.272 --> 00:38:57.212
So that's why he bought me new shoes.

00:38:58.342 --> 00:39:00.412
And here I was, wondering why he got me shoes out of the blue.

00:39:43.122 --> 00:39:44.122
Hello.

00:39:47.332 --> 00:39:48.332
Congratulations!

00:39:48.892 --> 00:39:49.892
Thank you.

00:39:49.992 --> 00:39:52.262
Now that you've received the IM, you're off to a good start.

00:39:54.402 --> 00:39:56.532
I'm surprised. This happened faster than I expected.

00:39:56.902 --> 00:39:58.841
Someone from the lead manager's team on the AP Group sale...

00:39:58.842 --> 00:40:00.872
heard your pitch.

00:40:01.912 --> 00:40:03.712
They strongly recommended you to AP Group...

00:40:04.082 --> 00:40:05.082
and insisted you get on the list.

00:40:07.452 --> 00:40:10.212
Really? The preliminary bidding's just ahead,

00:40:10.282 --> 00:40:11.282
so we'll have to move fast.

00:40:11.852 --> 00:40:14.052
(Chief Director Park Seong Jae)

00:40:14.122 --> 00:40:15.852
That investment in the showroom...

00:40:16.552 --> 00:40:18.022
and using it to fund the AP Group acquisition.

00:40:24.362 --> 00:40:26.402
Okay. I'm sure you saw this one coming.

00:40:28.072 --> 00:40:29.432
How about a little something extra?

00:40:30.102 --> 00:40:31.402
I got the IM from AP Group.

00:40:32.102 --> 00:40:34.012
That takes all the fun out of it.

00:40:34.512 --> 00:40:36.872
I was going to play hard to get with that "little something extra."

00:40:38.512 --> 00:40:40.312
Wait, so you were already...

00:40:40.412 --> 00:40:42.752
Yes, I did some digging on AP Group myself.

00:40:43.552 --> 00:40:45.222
But this time, it's an equity investment.

00:40:45.752 --> 00:40:48.722
- If the buyout fails, it's off. - Of course.

00:40:49.322 --> 00:40:51.892
Thanks for introducing me to such a capable advisory firm.

00:40:52.222 --> 00:40:53.262
Here.

00:40:54.792 --> 00:40:55.792
It's for our existing investors.

00:40:57.162 --> 00:40:58.602
A proposal to convert their funds for the deal.

00:40:58.762 --> 00:40:59.762
Take a look.

00:41:00.462 --> 00:41:04.142
Sung Guk already told me. He said you must be swamped now.

00:41:04.572 --> 00:41:05.572
Yes.

00:41:05.902 --> 00:41:07.772
I'm actually on my way to meet another investor right now.

00:41:08.442 --> 00:41:09.772
Thanks. I'm off.

00:41:11.412 --> 00:41:14.082
(Shoealls)

00:41:16.082 --> 00:41:17.752
He's a real bulldozer.

00:41:19.782 --> 00:41:21.092
- Thanks for all your hard work. - Thank you!

00:41:23.592 --> 00:41:26.762
You've worked so hard these past three days, Chief Gong.

00:41:26.822 --> 00:41:29.162
If the demolition alone was this much work,

00:41:29.792 --> 00:41:32.502
you've got a tough road ahead of you, Ms. Ji.

00:41:33.202 --> 00:41:34.902
Thank you. I'll be in touch.

00:41:34.972 --> 00:41:36.202
Okay. Yes.

00:41:53.992 --> 00:41:55.052
Oh, well...

00:41:59.792 --> 00:42:00.792
It's been a while.

00:42:01.492 --> 00:42:02.892
It's only been three days. You call that a while?

00:42:03.292 --> 00:42:06.402
Yes. We used to see each other every day.

00:42:08.072 --> 00:42:09.072
I guess so.

00:42:10.132 --> 00:42:12.302
The demolition for Suri-dong finished today, right?

00:42:13.042 --> 00:42:14.942
You should've gone home. You must be covered in dust.

00:42:15.642 --> 00:42:18.042
I'm here to review the interim plans with the turnkey team.

00:42:21.352 --> 00:42:22.352
You're busy.

00:42:23.352 --> 00:42:24.452
All right, enjoy your meal.

00:42:25.152 --> 00:42:26.252
How's it going?

00:42:27.292 --> 00:42:28.292
What?

00:42:29.122 --> 00:42:30.292
Stay for some coffee.

00:42:30.862 --> 00:42:32.792
And you can tell me how everything's going.

00:42:36.662 --> 00:42:38.732
I made the list of candidates for the AP Group acquisition.

00:42:40.832 --> 00:42:42.972
AP Group put you on the list?

00:42:44.272 --> 00:42:47.472
It seems someone at the sales firm heard my investment pitch.

00:42:48.272 --> 00:42:51.412
They pushed for us, saying we had the same vibe as early AP Group.

00:42:57.082 --> 00:43:01.192
But how did you even decide to start a business?

00:43:02.022 --> 00:43:04.292
You never used to be interested in business at all.

00:43:05.262 --> 00:43:06.462
I didn't know either.

00:43:06.822 --> 00:43:08.092
If I'd be any good at it.

00:43:08.862 --> 00:43:10.262
I didn't even know when I started.

00:43:11.332 --> 00:43:13.062
So how did you end up starting it?

00:43:15.902 --> 00:43:17.072
You really want to know?

00:43:19.842 --> 00:43:20.842
I do.

00:43:25.212 --> 00:43:26.282
Well...

00:43:27.912 --> 00:43:29.412
The day my wedding was called off,

00:43:30.552 --> 00:43:32.922
I just got on the first express bus out of there,

00:43:33.582 --> 00:43:35.192
and I ended up in Cheongpo.

00:43:36.592 --> 00:43:37.592
What?

00:43:37.992 --> 00:43:40.192
Cheongpo? Where Edel Orphanage is?

00:43:40.792 --> 00:43:41.792
Yes.

00:43:43.662 --> 00:43:46.832
I didn't want any time to think, so I just worked day and night.

00:43:47.702 --> 00:43:48.902
I didn't even want to sleep.

00:43:49.872 --> 00:43:50.902
I didn't want to dream.

00:43:54.142 --> 00:43:57.272
Since I couldn't do anything, I worked myself to the bone.

00:44:01.612 --> 00:44:02.652
But then,

00:44:04.152 --> 00:44:05.152
I really...

00:44:06.322 --> 00:44:08.521
I went through some awful moments that made me never go back...

00:44:08.522 --> 00:44:09.692
to the person I once was.

00:44:11.322 --> 00:44:13.062
I still don't even want to talk about those moments.

00:44:14.932 --> 00:44:16.762
Then one day, I met a newlywed couple.

00:44:16.832 --> 00:44:18.761
They were renovating their apartment themselves,

00:44:18.762 --> 00:44:20.162
and I helped with the work.

00:44:20.772 --> 00:44:21.772
So, mister,

00:44:22.302 --> 00:44:25.672
for now, could you please come in every day? Please?

00:44:25.742 --> 00:44:27.072
Yes, please.

00:44:27.342 --> 00:44:29.572
You can give my wife some pointers, you know?

00:44:29.642 --> 00:44:31.842
- Yes, please. - Since my freshman year of college,

00:44:32.682 --> 00:44:34.852
I'd been doing club volunteer work for over a decade,

00:44:35.482 --> 00:44:37.182
so as an amateur, I'd tried my hand at everything, you know?

00:44:37.782 --> 00:44:41.322
But still... "What am I, some interior design supervisor?"

00:44:41.592 --> 00:44:42.652
That's what I was thinking as I left.

00:44:47.792 --> 00:44:48.932
That's when it hit me.

00:44:50.902 --> 00:44:51.902
"Wait."

00:44:52.402 --> 00:44:53.862
"There must be a lot of people like them."

00:44:54.872 --> 00:44:56.932
"People who want to do their own DIY interior design,"

00:44:58.002 --> 00:45:00.202
"but are in way over their heads."

00:45:01.512 --> 00:45:04.612
The Mamdaerozip matching platform.

00:45:05.512 --> 00:45:06.682
I came up with it right then.

00:45:08.782 --> 00:45:09.882
And then what?

00:45:10.822 --> 00:45:12.552
It's not like that was an easy decision to make.

00:45:13.052 --> 00:45:14.122
I was mulling it over,

00:45:15.252 --> 00:45:18.422
and an older guy at the job site advised me to give up.

00:45:19.922 --> 00:45:21.362
On your business idea?

00:45:23.332 --> 00:45:27.002
No, he meant I should accept that I'd hit rock bottom,

00:45:28.272 --> 00:45:29.732
and to stop struggling.

00:45:30.332 --> 00:45:32.202
Just accept where you are in life.

00:45:32.972 --> 00:45:36.112
For every one who makes a comeback, there are thousands who don't.

00:45:36.642 --> 00:45:39.512
You'll get used to this soon enough. It'll be okay.

00:45:39.612 --> 00:45:42.352
So stop fighting it so hard and just give up.

00:45:42.812 --> 00:45:44.552
But in that moment, something just boiled up inside me.

00:45:47.422 --> 00:45:48.452
"No way."

00:45:49.792 --> 00:45:51.622
"I refuse to live my life broken like this."

00:45:53.862 --> 00:45:55.092
"I absolutely refuse."

00:46:01.472 --> 00:46:02.472
You...

00:46:05.302 --> 00:46:06.772
I didn't have the mental space to be considerate of you.

00:46:15.982 --> 00:46:17.012
I know.

00:46:17.752 --> 00:46:19.722
You said you had to survive.

00:46:21.292 --> 00:46:23.652
Will you die? If I'm around...

00:46:24.392 --> 00:46:25.892
If I'm in your space,

00:46:26.422 --> 00:46:27.762
will that kill you?

00:46:28.892 --> 00:46:29.992
I will die.

00:46:34.572 --> 00:46:35.602
I guess...

00:46:36.572 --> 00:46:39.342
I must have misunderstood a few things.

00:46:41.912 --> 00:46:43.142
That's just how people are.

00:46:44.812 --> 00:46:46.412
I didn't even really know myself back then.

00:46:47.812 --> 00:46:50.012
If I hadn't gone to Cheongpo back then,

00:46:50.282 --> 00:46:51.982
I'd probably still have no clue who I am.

00:46:54.692 --> 00:46:57.892
- The ramyeon's probably all soggy. - Right.

00:47:01.332 --> 00:47:02.932
Shoot, I'll get you a new bowl.

00:47:02.992 --> 00:47:05.462
No, it's fine. I'm so hungry I can't wait.

00:47:11.102 --> 00:47:13.702
Why is she acting so comfortable around me?

00:47:17.882 --> 00:47:20.482
Is that flimsy meal really going to be enough for you?

00:47:26.182 --> 00:47:27.992
(Suri-dong Lady)

00:47:29.122 --> 00:47:31.362
Yes, ma'am. This is Manager Ji.

00:47:32.662 --> 00:47:33.762
A blind date?

00:47:36.962 --> 00:47:39.632
- A blind date? - Yes.

00:47:42.602 --> 00:47:43.702
In that case, ma'am,

00:47:44.072 --> 00:47:46.572
could we talk about that after the construction is finished?

00:47:48.772 --> 00:47:49.772
Okay.

00:47:50.342 --> 00:47:51.912
I'll take some photos and send them over.

00:47:52.742 --> 00:47:54.012
Okay, talk to you later.

00:47:55.512 --> 00:47:56.512
Hey.

00:47:58.452 --> 00:47:59.622
Was that your client from Suri-dong?

00:48:00.252 --> 00:48:02.392
But a blind date?

00:48:02.752 --> 00:48:06.592
The client's sister came with her son,

00:48:06.922 --> 00:48:08.592
and I guess she wanted to set us up.

00:48:09.532 --> 00:48:12.632
Why'd you tell her to ask you again after the renovation's done?

00:48:13.002 --> 00:48:14.972
She might get disappointed with my work...

00:48:15.272 --> 00:48:17.232
and want to call it off, you know.

00:48:18.502 --> 00:48:19.572
So then...

00:48:20.242 --> 00:48:22.872
you're saying you might actually go on the blind date?

00:48:23.572 --> 00:48:24.612
Of course.

00:48:30.552 --> 00:48:31.582
She'd go on a blind date?

00:48:32.982 --> 00:48:33.982
A blind date?

00:48:37.392 --> 00:48:39.422
Jinhwa Group is an excellent match.

00:48:39.922 --> 00:48:42.462
A traditional pharmaceutical company that's also into biotech.

00:48:43.732 --> 00:48:45.002
I know, right?

00:48:45.662 --> 00:48:49.302
And they say his family loves that Yeong Ra is an artist.

00:48:50.202 --> 00:48:52.401
If they build her a big gallery a few years down the road,

00:48:52.402 --> 00:48:54.272
- that'd be amazing. - Right.

00:48:54.812 --> 00:48:57.142
- I'm home. - Oh, there's our girl.

00:48:58.612 --> 00:49:00.842
You look extra pretty today.

00:49:01.282 --> 00:49:03.382
You're positively glowing.

00:49:04.152 --> 00:49:06.522
Is it your solo exhibition and your debut as an artist?

00:49:06.922 --> 00:49:08.792
Please. You think that's it?

00:49:09.522 --> 00:49:14.262
She met a great guy and is on track. That's why she's so at ease.

00:49:16.632 --> 00:49:20.032
Right. So, were you on a date with Vice President Lee today?

00:49:20.362 --> 00:49:24.172
No. He's on a two-week business trip.

00:49:26.002 --> 00:49:28.872
So, Yeong Ra, do you like Vice President Lee?

00:49:31.712 --> 00:49:34.012
- I think so. - I see.

00:49:34.482 --> 00:49:38.252
Yeong Ra, don't rush things. Just date him for a few months.

00:49:39.622 --> 00:49:40.622
Okay.

00:49:58.902 --> 00:50:00.502
(Please Help Find, Missing)

00:50:01.742 --> 00:50:05.242
What if they didn't abandon you, but lost you instead?

00:50:06.442 --> 00:50:08.652
My parents could have lost me?

00:50:13.782 --> 00:50:14.992
Eun Oh, where are you?

00:50:15.322 --> 00:50:16.752
Do you want me to bring over some meat?

00:50:17.322 --> 00:50:19.922
You need your strength for all that renovation work.

00:50:21.292 --> 00:50:22.362
That sounds great.

00:50:22.692 --> 00:50:23.962
I'm on my way home now.

00:50:29.202 --> 00:50:31.872

(Damga Charcoal Grill)

00:50:41.582 --> 00:50:45.282
Gang Oh, that's enough. I'm saving the rest for your sister.

00:50:45.882 --> 00:50:46.882
Isn't there any more?

00:50:47.022 --> 00:50:49.721
Gosh, ever since you came back,

00:50:49.722 --> 00:50:52.192
all you've been eating is my home-cooked meat.

00:50:52.462 --> 00:50:54.162
I guess it's because I couldn't have it when I wanted.

00:50:54.632 --> 00:50:55.762
It never gets old.

00:50:56.232 --> 00:50:58.862
Mom, why don't we sell this?

00:50:59.332 --> 00:51:03.102
You want to sell my marinade at our franchise restaurant?

00:51:03.872 --> 00:51:05.302
But it's a one-of-a-kind recipe.

00:51:05.572 --> 00:51:07.942
It's a secret recipe handed down from my great-grandmother.

00:51:09.112 --> 00:51:10.872
I'll make another batch tomorrow,

00:51:11.142 --> 00:51:12.242
but it won't be ready for a week.

00:51:12.412 --> 00:51:16.512
Gosh, Eun Oh isn't dating anyone, so she can't even go for barbecue.

00:51:17.952 --> 00:51:21.352
I know. She should at least be dating someone.

00:51:21.422 --> 00:51:25.292
It will be hard. She fell hard and got rejected badly.

00:51:25.392 --> 00:51:29.832
I just don't get it. Why would anyone reject our Eun Oh?

00:51:29.992 --> 00:51:32.932
She's so pretty, kind, and thoughtful.

00:51:41.272 --> 00:51:42.442
This is really nice.

00:51:42.842 --> 00:51:45.282
I'm getting VIP treatment, better than the cafe.

00:51:45.942 --> 00:51:47.412
Plus, the coffee's free.

00:51:47.842 --> 00:51:48.852
That's true.

00:51:50.612 --> 00:51:53.082
So, what was it you wanted to ask me?

00:51:54.482 --> 00:51:55.522
Right.

00:51:57.422 --> 00:51:58.822
This might seem out of the blue.

00:51:59.462 --> 00:52:02.962
What you said at the farewell party has been stuck in my head.

00:52:04.292 --> 00:52:06.162
What did I say?

00:52:07.732 --> 00:52:11.172
The fact that Ji Hyuk chose to get married like that...

00:52:11.242 --> 00:52:13.242
was a little disappointing, but not enough to hate him forever.

00:52:13.442 --> 00:52:14.742
There was more to it than that.

00:52:15.172 --> 00:52:16.572
Did something else happen?

00:52:18.212 --> 00:52:20.582
When Ji Hyuk rejected you,

00:52:20.982 --> 00:52:23.012
did something else happen that we don't know about?

00:52:28.722 --> 00:52:29.722
Yes, there was.

00:52:31.592 --> 00:52:34.492
It's all in the past now. And since it's you...

00:52:35.262 --> 00:52:38.502
When Ji Hyuk rejected my confession,

00:52:39.402 --> 00:52:41.502
he said we weren't a good match.

00:52:42.572 --> 00:52:43.672
Not a good match?

00:52:46.572 --> 00:52:47.642
You...

00:52:49.072 --> 00:52:50.112
don't suit me.

00:52:50.412 --> 00:52:51.512
We're not a good match.

00:52:52.242 --> 00:52:53.242
You and I.

00:52:54.912 --> 00:52:55.912
But...

00:52:56.512 --> 00:52:59.452
Ji Hyuk just wouldn't give me a reason.

00:53:00.722 --> 00:53:01.722
So I told him...

00:53:01.723 --> 00:53:04.152
So, I need you to explain it to me in detail.

00:53:04.892 --> 00:53:07.262
Why don't I deserve to be with you?

00:53:07.462 --> 00:53:08.692
When someone...

00:53:09.232 --> 00:53:12.532
doesn't meet your standards, you say the person doesn't suit you.

00:53:15.002 --> 00:53:16.172
And then,

00:53:17.072 --> 00:53:19.842
I heard the news about his engagement to Jung Bo A.

00:53:20.802 --> 00:53:21.872
Wait a minute.

00:53:22.572 --> 00:53:24.742
Don't tell me when he said you weren't a good match,

00:53:25.312 --> 00:53:26.812
you thought he meant your background.

00:53:27.612 --> 00:53:28.982
But it was true, wasn't it?

00:53:29.682 --> 00:53:32.382
After all, he was going to marry Haneul Construction's daughter.

00:53:34.322 --> 00:53:37.922
He's the kind of man to go through with a loveless marriage like that.

00:53:38.662 --> 00:53:41.162
So someone like me never stood a chance.

00:53:42.862 --> 00:53:44.132
I was just...

00:53:44.932 --> 00:53:46.602
so completely out of his league.

00:53:49.272 --> 00:53:50.302
That's not it at all.

00:53:53.002 --> 00:53:54.002
What?

00:53:57.312 --> 00:54:00.012
I'm going to learn scuba diving next spring.

00:54:00.642 --> 00:54:03.382
If you keep spending like this, how will you save for your wedding?

00:54:03.682 --> 00:54:05.052
Hey, have you lost your memory?

00:54:05.622 --> 00:54:07.752
I don't believe in marriage. I told you. I won't get married.

00:54:08.652 --> 00:54:10.952
I'm just going to live my life looking out for myself.

00:54:12.092 --> 00:54:13.092
That's the life that suits me.

00:54:15.492 --> 00:54:17.692
Then what about Eun Oh?

00:54:18.732 --> 00:54:20.402
Do you still only see her as a friend?

00:54:21.932 --> 00:54:24.032
What's with that weird tone?

00:54:24.332 --> 00:54:28.072
Eun Oh and I are like family. You know that.

00:54:28.942 --> 00:54:29.942
Yes.

00:54:30.542 --> 00:54:31.542
Wait, don't tell me...

00:54:32.242 --> 00:54:33.882
you're interested in Eun Oh again, are you?

00:54:34.812 --> 00:54:36.012
Not "again."

00:54:36.512 --> 00:54:38.152
I never lost interest.

00:54:39.522 --> 00:54:40.782
I told you back in college.

00:54:41.352 --> 00:54:44.862
- That it would never work. - Yes, long-distance from the US.

00:54:45.862 --> 00:54:46.922
I guess that was asking too much.

00:54:47.522 --> 00:54:50.332
Why did I listen to you back then? Sometimes, I regret it.

00:54:50.492 --> 00:54:52.902
I don't care if Yeo Jin was the one who pursued you.

00:54:53.462 --> 00:54:54.832
You still got married.

00:54:55.132 --> 00:54:57.372
Besides, have you forgotten how you two got divorced?

00:54:57.702 --> 00:55:00.042
How did your father tear you two apart?

00:55:01.372 --> 00:55:02.612
Don't even think about Eun Oh.

00:55:03.842 --> 00:55:05.582
Once I come back with my MBA,

00:55:05.882 --> 00:55:09.012
- I can break free from my parents. - Seong Jae, I told you this before.

00:55:09.712 --> 00:55:13.652
Ever since I met her in our club, Eun Oh's had it rough for six years.

00:55:14.052 --> 00:55:16.152
Juggling 2 to 3 tutoring jobs to support her family,

00:55:16.252 --> 00:55:17.752
and on top of that, she was on a scholarship.

00:55:18.092 --> 00:55:19.822
And she never missed a single volunteer day.

00:55:20.862 --> 00:55:22.691
I've never seen anyone manage so much...

00:55:22.692 --> 00:55:24.632
with as much fortitude as Eun Oh.

00:55:25.832 --> 00:55:26.862
I know.

00:55:27.502 --> 00:55:28.632
That's why I think...

00:55:29.332 --> 00:55:30.872
someone like Ji Eun Oh...

00:55:31.332 --> 00:55:33.942
deserves a life that makes up for all her hardships.

00:55:35.272 --> 00:55:36.542
But Ji Hyuk, for me,

00:55:37.512 --> 00:55:39.282
I feel warm whenever I see Ji Eun Oh.

00:55:40.142 --> 00:55:41.312
Just warm.

00:55:41.782 --> 00:55:43.412
Like a ray of bright sunshine.

00:55:43.952 --> 00:55:45.522
From the first moment I saw her until now.

00:55:46.252 --> 00:55:47.352
So...

00:55:47.952 --> 00:55:49.422
I feel like I should confess my feelings at least once.

00:55:49.992 --> 00:55:50.992
Don't.

00:55:51.422 --> 00:55:52.492
It absolutely cannot be you.

00:55:53.192 --> 00:55:55.832
Eun Oh needs someone who's capable,

00:55:56.462 --> 00:55:58.532
someone who can support her and her family.

00:56:00.302 --> 00:56:02.032
And someone who truly loves her.

00:56:03.002 --> 00:56:04.772
A warm man with a backbone. That's who she needs.

00:56:06.642 --> 00:56:08.542
Do you really not have any feelings for her?

00:56:08.912 --> 00:56:10.312
You care about Eun Oh so much.

00:56:10.972 --> 00:56:13.842
Hey, she's like a sister to me. How could I possibly feel that way?

00:56:14.012 --> 00:56:16.882
Besides, a guy like me is out of the question.

00:56:18.452 --> 00:56:20.882
My family's nothing special, and I'm just an office worker.

00:56:21.492 --> 00:56:25.462
A guy who can't support her family and only thinks of himself.

00:56:25.862 --> 00:56:28.392
I'm not the one for her either, you get it?

00:56:30.532 --> 00:56:31.532
Director Park.

00:56:32.332 --> 00:56:34.002
What are you thinking so hard about?

00:56:37.502 --> 00:56:38.642
I was just thinking...

00:56:39.242 --> 00:56:41.572
that you've got it all wrong about Ji Hyuk.

00:56:43.072 --> 00:56:44.642
What do you mean?

00:56:45.312 --> 00:56:47.342
When Ji Hyuk said you two weren't a good match,

00:56:47.912 --> 00:56:51.282
he probably meant that he's the one who isn't good enough for you.

00:56:54.822 --> 00:56:56.522
What do you mean by that?

00:56:57.492 --> 00:56:59.022
He said you deserved to meet a capable man.

00:56:59.462 --> 00:57:02.162
Someone warm who will love you dearly...

00:57:02.692 --> 00:57:04.191
and can even care for your family.

00:57:04.192 --> 00:57:06.032
He told me you should meet a man like that.

00:57:06.662 --> 00:57:08.472
Not a guy like me who comes from a good family...

00:57:08.872 --> 00:57:11.102
but has a difficult father.

00:57:11.572 --> 00:57:15.342
Nor a guy like Ji Hyuk, too ordinary to be of any help to you.

00:57:20.442 --> 00:57:22.012
I think when he turned you down,

00:57:23.012 --> 00:57:24.852
that's probably why he said it that way.

00:57:30.052 --> 00:57:31.252
Then why didn't he...

00:57:32.022 --> 00:57:33.792
just tell me that himself?

00:57:34.722 --> 00:57:35.932
I'm not sure either.

00:57:36.662 --> 00:57:37.762
"Not a good match."

00:57:38.362 --> 00:57:39.862
I just found out he said that.

00:57:49.972 --> 00:57:53.882
Yes, if we could acquire AP Group, it would be a jackpot.

00:57:53.942 --> 00:57:56.382
But the thing is...

00:57:57.582 --> 00:58:00.052
In any case, he's been shortlisted.

00:58:00.122 --> 00:58:02.522
Please help me out. It's about the showroom funds.

00:58:02.722 --> 00:58:04.652
If you could convert that into funds for the AP Group acquisition,

00:58:05.022 --> 00:58:07.662
it would be a tremendous help in securing further investment.

00:58:08.662 --> 00:58:12.062
The manager is so sharp, and there's nothing she can't do.

00:58:12.302 --> 00:58:14.362
- Thank you. - She'd be a great daughter-in-law.

00:58:14.432 --> 00:58:16.372
- The space itself is so wonderful. - Come on.

00:58:16.802 --> 00:58:19.401
- You're just so talented. - Thank you.

00:58:19.402 --> 00:58:21.912
She looks like the Suri-dong client.

00:58:25.312 --> 00:58:26.312
Cheol Min.

00:58:28.142 --> 00:58:29.912
Any idea why she's here?

00:58:31.412 --> 00:58:33.922
I think she's here to invite Ms. Ji somewhere.

00:58:34.852 --> 00:58:36.122
An invitation? Where to?

00:58:37.192 --> 00:58:38.192
Wait.

00:58:38.822 --> 00:58:41.422
- Why? - Something about her nephew...

00:58:42.962 --> 00:58:45.202
Don't you think she's trying to set her up?

00:58:48.432 --> 00:58:49.602
Her nephew?

00:58:52.872 --> 00:58:56.542
My son is such a great catch. It's not just a mother's pride.

00:58:56.972 --> 00:58:58.112
- That's right. - How...

00:58:58.982 --> 00:59:01.682
He's prime husband material. He's a lawyer.

00:59:19.502 --> 00:59:20.562
A blind date.

00:59:21.062 --> 00:59:22.072
A blind date.

00:59:22.332 --> 00:59:24.772
A blind date?

00:59:28.642 --> 00:59:29.672
(Audit Report)

00:59:36.652 --> 00:59:39.122
What's the status on the investment conversion?

00:59:50.192 --> 00:59:51.292
Well...

00:59:52.462 --> 00:59:54.802
It all got approved.

00:59:56.102 --> 00:59:57.132
That's great.

00:59:57.672 --> 00:59:59.102
I guess now...

00:59:59.672 --> 01:00:01.402
the real investment war begins.

01:00:02.642 --> 01:00:03.642
Yes.

01:00:06.782 --> 01:00:08.752
What brings you here?

01:00:13.982 --> 01:00:18.762
I saw your visitor on my way in and wondered if there was a problem.

01:00:21.522 --> 01:00:22.732
No, it's nothing like that.

01:00:24.162 --> 01:00:26.302
Apparently, the client's nephew is a lawyer.

01:00:26.732 --> 01:00:28.772
He's opening a law firm with a few partners,

01:00:29.132 --> 01:00:30.972
and she came to invite me to the opening party.

01:00:32.442 --> 01:00:35.642
Sounds like a blind date disguised as an opening party.

01:00:37.312 --> 01:00:38.512
Seems that way, doesn't it?

01:00:39.982 --> 01:00:41.242
You're going to go?

01:00:42.312 --> 01:00:43.312
Yes.

01:00:43.782 --> 01:00:45.982
- Why? - What do you mean, why?

01:00:46.482 --> 01:00:49.722
Well, I'm 30 now, and if I want to start a family,

01:00:49.992 --> 01:00:51.422
it's about time I started meeting good people.

01:00:54.822 --> 01:00:56.992
You want to get married?

01:00:57.432 --> 01:00:59.002
It's not like I'm against getting married.

01:01:00.162 --> 01:01:02.572
Did I ever say I wasn't going to get married?

01:01:04.532 --> 01:01:05.542
No.

01:01:07.942 --> 01:01:09.342
But is he a good guy?

01:01:11.012 --> 01:01:12.842
You don't know anything about him other than his job.

01:01:14.242 --> 01:01:17.352
I'm just worried you'll end up with another weirdo like in college.

01:01:18.722 --> 01:01:20.382
I'm not in college anymore, you know.

01:01:21.252 --> 01:01:23.792
Besides, you never really know at first.

01:01:24.292 --> 01:01:25.692
You have to meet someone to get to know them.

01:01:28.392 --> 01:01:31.862
Wait. You said you'd think about it after the renovation.

01:01:32.732 --> 01:01:34.932
What if things get complicated between you two,

01:01:35.232 --> 01:01:37.602
and it ends up affecting the renovation project?

01:01:38.642 --> 01:01:40.502
You're more responsible than that.

01:01:41.602 --> 01:01:43.142
Why are you being...

01:01:43.942 --> 01:01:45.642
so reckless?

01:01:47.282 --> 01:01:48.382
That's enough.

01:01:48.882 --> 01:01:49.982
I can handle it myself.

01:01:53.752 --> 01:01:54.782
No.

01:01:56.792 --> 01:01:57.792
What?

01:01:58.452 --> 01:01:59.462
You can't.

01:02:00.592 --> 01:02:01.592
Don't go.

01:02:04.832 --> 01:02:06.562
Please just leave now.

01:02:07.902 --> 01:02:08.902
I can't do this.

01:02:11.002 --> 01:02:12.302
I just can't do this anymore.

01:02:16.112 --> 01:02:17.642
I can't, because I like you too much.

01:02:20.882 --> 01:02:21.882
I...

01:02:25.152 --> 01:02:26.482
I can't let you go,

01:02:27.082 --> 01:02:28.082
Eun Oh.

01:03:14.862 --> 01:03:17.402
(Our Golden Days)

01:03:17.772 --> 01:03:22.242
I can't just let this go. How can a rookie like you...

01:03:22.312 --> 01:03:25.282
- jump straight to the top? - Dad, enough!

01:03:25.442 --> 01:03:29.052
But you still should have told me.

01:03:29.182 --> 01:03:30.782
I'm your daughter.

01:03:31.152 --> 01:03:33.322
Dad, what has gotten into you?

01:03:33.522 --> 01:03:35.422
I like that you're not like most girls these days.

01:03:35.492 --> 01:03:38.122
Yeong Ra, you're something else. How can you be so...

01:03:38.192 --> 01:03:41.492
- clueless about who you even are? - I confessed my feelings to Eun Oh.

01:03:41.622 --> 01:03:45.062
Don't feel bad on my account. I'm not telling Eun Oh how I feel.

01:03:45.132 --> 01:03:46.132
What?
